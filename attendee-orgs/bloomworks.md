## About

We’re Bloom
We're a mission-driven public benefit company with roots in government. By centering people, we make sure systems work for the communities who rely on them. We know the challenges our partners face, and we're committed to fixing them together.

### What we do
We work alongside government and purpose-driven organizations to build capacity and create intuitive digital services. Technology changes quickly. And most government policies aren't designed to make change easy. We're here to help you adapt to evolving needs—and avoid wasting money on the wrong solutions.

## mission
We aim to advance access and equity by building digital services that work seamlessly for the people who rely on them.

## values
We weave these values into every project we take on at Bloom:

Lead with courage: Welcome ambiguity. Remember that challenging the status quo requires stepping into uncharted territory.
Center the people: Seek an understanding of people’s lived experiences, and challenge systems that perpetuate inequities.
Share the process: Cultivate mutual trust between peers, partners, and clients. Leave egos behind, and share findings.
Adapt to challenges: Pursue excellence by being curious, determined, and willing to change plans. Make only new mistakes.
Design for impact: Come with high expectations but be cognizant of constraints. Create processes that people can actually use and build on over time.

## Our story
Lauren Lockwood created Bloom Works in 2018 after creating the first digital services team for the City of Boston. In 2019, she joined up with Emily Wright-Moore, a founding member of the U.S. Digital Service team and lead designer of VA.gov. They put together a dream team of brilliant researchers, designers, and developers to become the company they wish they had when they worked in government.

The Bloom team knows firsthand the challenges of modernizing services. We've worked with legacy systems and bureaucratic teams that made it nearly impossible to put a simple form online — or to bring modern change to the workplace.

As former government workers, when we tried to hire outside help, we found people who were more interested in keeping us locked into their contracts than in solving our problems. Bloom is different. You'll never find us trying to sell you our code or keep you tied to custom hosting. We're here to help you navigate complex paths to make your lives easier — and your vision achievable.
