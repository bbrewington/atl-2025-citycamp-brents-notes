## About Us

For decades, governments, institutions, and organizations across the globe have been creating data reports to communicate the impacts of local social and environmental challenges. These reports are intended to reach a 4-part audience: Investors, Regulators, Employees, and Consumers— in that order, unfortunately.

The problem is that reports aren’t inspiring action fast enough. This is largely because institutional trust is so low, and partly because reports don’t make people FEEL.  We’re translating data into artistic messages to inspire and support mindset shifts around local challenges across the globe.

## Key Problem

Organizations sturggle to translate data for community audiences, because:
1. Lack of Knowledge: Executives are not data visualization experts
2. Complexity: Impact investors don't know where to start
3. Inaccessible Outputs: Reporting solutions generate lengthy, complex documents

## Benefits

- Enhanced stakeholder relations: Build trust with experiences, not annual reports
- Reimagined data visualization: Unlock compelling narratives, resonate with target audiences
- Market leadership: Pioneer transformational solutions through civic participation
- Impact Stability: Ensure broader access to key messages of initiatives
- Diversity investment portfolio: Mitigate overall risk, yield significant SROL
- Enhance CSR program & starategy: Integrate inner development for internal capacity building

## Solution

Introducing Experience Reports

An *Experience Report* is a socially-engaged art intervention where artists, designers, technologists, and communication experts bring stakeholder data to life. These experiences are specifically designed to *engage core cultural identities* of communities, investors, employees, and other target stakeholders through measurable behavior actions.
