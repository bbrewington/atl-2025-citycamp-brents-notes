## about CHARRS

CHARRS is an environmental health organization whose work is intergenerational and interdisciplinary with a focus on equity, health, and Environmental Justice in African American and marginalized communities.

### Our mission

To develop solutions to environmental justice issues, social, education, and economic inequities, and health disparities that impede access to health and wellness in African American and other marginalized communities; by viewing them through an environmental and social determinants of Health lens.​​

### Our vision

Engaged and Informed communities are strengthened by intergenerational relationships and hands-on traditional and non-traditional education opportunities. Who they use that knowledge to build and leverage partnerships and advocate for their right to a life of health and well-being in the natural and built environments where they live.

CHARRS is an environmental health organization

## Notes from OEDP Playbook

Located in Atlanta, Georgia, Community Health Aligning Revitalization Resilience & Sustainability (CHARRS ↗) is an organization that examines the social determinants of health and their impact on African American and other underserved communities in order to implement solutions to the inequities and injustices associated with them. CHAARS is currently collecting hyper-local air quality data using reference and handheld monitors. The organization is developing and involved with multiple projects, including PROJECT REMOVE ↗ and AQEarth ↗, across which they seek to expand data accessibility to EJ nonprofits and community members. CHARRS invited Dr. Na’Taki Osbourne-Jelks from the West Atlanta Watershed Alliance (WAWA ↗) to participate in our collaboration. Dr. Osbourne-Jelks is “working to improve the quality of life within the West Atlanta Watershed by protecting, preserving and restoring [the] community’s natural resources.”9 WAWA represents African American neighborhoods in West Atlanta that are most inundated with environmental stressors and least represented at environmental decision-making tables.

CHALLENGES
CHARRS has several challenges surrounding the usage, sharing, and general governance of its data. The data CHARRS collects are safely secured, stored in CSV and XLS files, but currently closed to the public, and the datasets lack deeper analysis and context. CHARRS wants to be able to provide access to aspects of the data while ensuring that the data doesn’t identify specific people or locations. CHARRS has strong relationships with local universities and other EJ organizations in the region, so it wants to safely share data with relevant collaborators, but lacks the data sharing and use agreements that might ease this sharing. During our collaboration, CHARRS had one full-time employee, thus had limited capacity to develop these resources. The interoperability of its data (or lack thereof) poses another challenge for CHARRS. CHARRS has quantitative data from the AQEarth project and are interested in finding ways to tell a more representative narrative of pollution and its impacts. CHARRS and WAWA also noted that they want to use the data from government sources like the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) PLACES population health data ↗ and the EPA’s Criteria Pollutant data ↗ to perform localized analysis alongside their own collected data on air and water quality. However, it is difficult to analyze these datasets together alongside CHARRS’s collected data because of the difficulty matching up the geographic scopes, or differences in units of measurement. CHARRS’s longer-term goal is to build a platform where data can be uploaded, managed, and shared among different EJ organizations, the public in Atlanta, and, eventually, all of Georgia

CURRENT GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

As mentioned above, the data from each of CHARRS’s collaborations (AQEarth and Project REMOVE) is currently not public. There are slightly different governance and management structures for each project, since each includes different collaborators. For example, with Project REMOVE, which collects radon data, the metadata comes to CHARRS ready to use and is publicly shared. This data is stored by Georgia State University and is under Dr. Dajun Dai’s control. AQEarth datasets are stored on Montrose Environmental’s servers, on their Sensible Environmental Data Platform ↗, and are not currently open to the public. Decisions about this data are made collaboratively by the respective project teams, and CHARRS is interested in understanding what shared data ownership and preservation could look like over time.  

GOALS

With CHARRS, we collectively delineated three central targets to address in the workshop:
1) Establish elements of a future data governance framework for data stored in a central repository,
2) Build data governance skills to support intentional
sharing, and
3) Develop a list of data science and management questions to inform how CHARRS hires researchers and
writes grants.
These modules largely focused on the data that CHARRS currently has, but also provided space to workshop potential future governance for a platform that is collaboratively managed by (or at least sourced from and used by) the broader community of EJ-focused organizations in Georgia. CHARRS recognized that it would be useful to understand how to approach questions of data governance and stewardship before a technical tool was developed.

IN THE WORKSHOP

We designed the workshop to cover three modules:
1) future sharing and data frameworks,
2) a data sharing agreement building exercise, and
3) data science and management question prioritization and preparation. We had a three-hour virtual workshop to run through these modules with Gwen Smith of CHARRS and Na’Taki Osbourne Jelks of WAWA.

The first module identified some possible design features of a central repository that would enable CHARRS to share and co-manage data with other regional EJ organizations. Through facilitated brainstorming exercises, we identified the potential types of data, stakeholders, roles and permissions, and technical features that could support its preferred sharing methods and governance approaches. The potential data types included data both currently managed by CHARRS and WAWA, as well as more expansive types of climate, environmental, and health data, including brownfield data,15 heat island data, and information about local emergency and risk planning. They are interested in understanding environmental and health issues holistically, and these additional datasets would support further analysis and programming. See a full list of data types in FIGURE 7. Potential stakeholders included state EJ groups, students enrolled in primary and secondary education, Atlanta city councilmembers, community  residents, and state elected officials. Stakeholder roles and permissions would depend on 1) what they would want to use data for, 2) what data they would contribute, and 3) what level of data literacy and capacity for data management they had. Our conversations around these questions made explicit some opportunities and limitations for certain groups, and also built an understanding of what types of data could be shared—and how—within this system, i.e., who would get access to all of the data, a limited portion of the data, or data products.

Through the module, we made note of particular design features that would not only accommodate the data types, stakeholders, and roles and responsibilities identified, but also respond to existing challenges in current data needs and management capacities. The following table lays out both these challenges and how specific design considerations could be implemented to address them.

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN NORTH AND SOUTHWEST ATLANTA

CHARRS and WAWA work largely in neighborhoods in West Atlanta, made up mostly of African Americans who have lived in this area due to histories of racial and economic segregation—in the 1950s and 60s, redlining and the placement of Interstate 20 solidified segregation, and thus, unequal opportunity and adverse living conditions.10 Communities in this area have been battling environmental injustices since as early as 1900 when activists opposed the actions of a furnace operator who was dumping waste into Proctor Creek.11 Today, these communities are still actively fighting for cleaner water, air, and land. A 2012 report from GreenLaw determined that a section of West Atlanta ranked highest among other pollution hotspots in Metro Atlanta, largely because it has historically contained the largest warehousing and transportation building concentration east of the Mississippi River.[^12] The Chattahoochee River, the lifeblood of the city and region, runs less than a mile from many of the resulting pollution sources. Both inactive and active industrial sites across West Atlanta contribute to the release of toxic chemicals into the air and waterways, and leaching into the soil. Another threat to Atlanta waterways comes from outdated and problem-prone sewage infrastructure. In a decades-long ordeal, overflow events occur after heavy rainfall when the volume of water flowing through the pipes (carrying sewage, rainwater drainage, and industrial wastewater) exceeds the wastewater treatment plant capacity. Some excess water must be diverted to nearby waterways or out of manholes into city streets, contaminating them with untreated or partially treated sewage.[^13] Climate change exacerbates this issue with more frequent, unpredictable, and extreme rainfall events. Activists have been organizing to address this kind of contamination since the 1990s. Today, organizations including CHARRS and WAWA are working to engage residents from these communities on these issues while also supplying them with the data and tools to elevate their voices and seek self-determined outcomes for environmental, policy, and systems change.[^14]
