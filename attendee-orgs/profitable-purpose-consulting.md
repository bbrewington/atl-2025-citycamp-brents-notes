## Vision

Help companies grow stronger by doing more good. 

## Purpose

Capitalism re-imagined: where purpose drives profit and profit powers change. 

We link community impact to commercial results so leaders can scale both their business and their impact. 

## Mission

Design and deploy end-to-end impact programs that make business better to work for, buy from and believe in.

## Core Values

Progress Over Perfection
We believe forward momentum beats flawless plans. Perfect can get in the way of possible and real impact happens when we take smart action, measure, and adapt.

Purpose with Profit
We align every initiative to both values and results. Purpose drives profit, and profit powers change and we make sure both move forward together.

Evidence Before Ego
We let proof guide our decisions, not personal preference or popular trends. Every claim we make is backed by data, and every story we tell is anchored in truth.

Partnership, Not Posturing
We work alongside our clients as collaborators, not consultants on a pedestal. We succeed when you succeed, and we measure ourselves by the impact we help you create

Human-Centered at Every Step
Business is about people: employees, customers, communities. We design strategies and cultures where people thrive, because that’s how organizations grow and give back.

Courage to Challenge
We don’t shy away from hard questions or honest conversations. Challenging the status quo is part of building better companies and better outcomes.

## Who We Work With
Founder and mid-market CEO who wants growth and reputation lift without political baggage.
CMOs and Heads of Brand who need credible purpose stories backed by metrics.
CHROs/People leaders who must recruit, retain and develop mission-driven talent
ESG, CSR and community relations leaders who need clarity, roadmap and proof

## Our Services

Community Impact
Real, reciprocal relationships with the communities where you operate—not charity, not PR. Whether it’s investing in local initiatives or building multi-year partnerships, we help companies shift from short-term thinking to ecosystem building.

Volunteer & Pro Bono Engagement
Your people want to do more than collect a paycheck. We design programs that use your team’s unique skills to serve nonprofits, support entrepreneurs, and build trust. It’s about connecting purpose to practice.

Authentic, Impactful, and Outcome Driven Employee & Supplier Strategy
We don’t believe in performative DEI. We work with companies committed to driving real outcomes—like spending with Black-owned businesses, building a talent pipeline strategy, and creating internal systems that let all employees thrive. Long-term thinking, real investment, and measurable change.

Impact Storytelling & Creating an Impact Brand
It’s time to rethink how we think about giving back. When we design our impact strategies around our brand, they are an investment in the growth of your business. We build all of our work with your bottom line in mind, and making sure you’re doing well by doing good.

B Corp Certification
We’ve certified over 50 B Corps around the world, and we’ve worked with multiple industries. From restaurants to landscapers and consulting firms to breweries, we’ve seen it all and are here to do more than help you check boxes. We’re here to use the B Corp process to reimagine how you do business and to build a company that is not only better for the world, but better for your bottom line.
