INTRODUCTION

Bloom Works led a wide range of collaborative projects in 2024 that have created meaningful
beneﬁts for public service workers and the general public. Our work helped veterans seeking
services on VA.gov, Vermont residents learn about unemployment beneﬁts, and child welfare
practitioners navigate the foster care system more effectively.

Bloom brings together primary contractors, subcontractors, subject-matter experts, full-time
staff, and research participants. Our integrated approach allows us to deliver innovative solutions
and take on projects that extend beyond the scope of a traditional digital services company.

INTENTIONS

Bloom made a commitment to our team and clients to work toward 3 primary intentions in 2024:

●

Invest in our current team: Redirect time and resources previously spent in expanding the
team toward supporting our current team.

●  Deepen project impact: Deﬁne impact in terms of project outcomes and prune and

experiment toward those outcomes with intention.

●  Sow success in the larger community: Share our work and methods to generate

momentum and help others contribute toward improved public interest outcomes.

IMPACT

Investing in the current team

Bloom has invested heavily in growing our senior staff and operations teams to provide a more
robust support system for the full team. Our expanded senior leadership team applied their
experience and expertise to overhaul our employee handbook and code of conduct, with a goal of
building a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable workplace.

Bloom not only provides a stipend that employees can use toward professional development—but
we provide access to coaching and different opportunities for spending the stipend. Bloom also
closes one week in the summer and one week during the winter holiday to allow all employees to
rest and reset at the same time. These 2 closures are provided in addition to existing paid leave
policies to improve work and life balance. In 2024, Bloom also added a paid emergency leave policy
for all impacted team members to use following natural disasters and other unexpected
emergencies.

Deepening the project impact

Bloom has invested deeply in our partnerships with clients to provide training and support. We’re
committed to setting up our clients for success, even after our formal engagements have wrapped

up. Bloom’s clients include government agencies, non-proﬁt organizations, peer companies, and
philanthropic funders. Some examples of our 2024 clients include:

●  California Office of Data and Innovation
●  Vermont Department of Labor
●  Washington Behavioral Health Department
●  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO)
●  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Grants
●  ACE Interface: The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study
●  Ballmer Group

In our work with the VA Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO), we helped communicate to
veterans the impacts of a new policy called the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of
2022 (PACT) Act. The PACT Act is one of the largest beneﬁt expansion bills for veterans in U.S.
history. We helped edit and publish a central page with clear information and answers to questions
veterans were asking. The page went live the same day the bill was passed. It received more than 1
million page views within the ﬁrst 10 days of it going live, and it reached the number 1 position on
Google for “pact act.” In 2024, we continued to update it—as well as the versions translated into
Tagalog and Spanish—and make sure it was accurate as different parts of the law went into effect.

To comply with PACT Act, VA added questions about toxic exposure to the online VA health care
application. We worked with the health applications team collaboratively to make sure the
questions were clearer, more accessible, and easier to understand.

Sowing success in the larger community

This year, we deepened our work in child welfare and social services. Our research has helped
shape best practices with states and jurisdictions on timely and crucial topics like queer safety and
kinship placement. Many of these best practices are shared in the child welfare playbook we
created in partnership with New America, Foster America, and Think of Us. The playbook is
designed to help policy makers and practitioners in the child welfare space to copy and learn from
on-the-ground research and other states’ successes and failures.

We also created our own publicly-available discovery sprint playbook. This playbook serves as a
ﬁeld guide to help our staff—and anyone else—navigate tricky problems and challenges through
research and discovery.

In 2024, we set an intention to actively share knowledge and project opportunities with like-minded
peer organizations. Bloom created a partnership with Systone, a newly established public-interest
tech organization and minority-owned business. Through this collaboration, Systone successfully
ﬁlled about 25% of the roles on Bloom’s largest federal engagement with the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services’ Office of Grants.

CHALLENGES

Systemic underfunding presents signiﬁcant roadblocks to small businesses. Small businesses take
on more risk when they spend time and money trying to win government contracts. By
underfunding projects, governments inadvertently favor large, incumbent companies who can
afford to work for less. Larger companies bidding on the work makes it seem like the current
funding levels are ﬁne, even though the funding levels and requirements to bid make it hard for
small businesses to compete.

Quickly ﬂuctuating policies can also place a large burden on federal contractors. The compliance
and cooperation in oversight measures can demand a signiﬁcant amount of distraction and focus
from the intended work. In addition, complex or vague regulations that contractors and staff need
to interpret and implement on their own can add additional challenges for small-business
contractors. Fluctuating policies can also beneﬁt large, incumbent contractors who have the
resources to interpret and comply with ever-changing regulatory requirements.

OUTSIDE ASSESSMENT

Bloom Works used the B Impact Assessment standard to thoroughly measure its public beneﬁt
efforts. This management tool, used by over 50,000 businesses worldwide, including over 3,000
Certiﬁed B Corporations, helps companies assess their impact on various stakeholders. This
includes their workers, the community, customers, and the environment. Bloom selected the B
Impact Assessment for its thorough process and relevance to Bloom’s work. The standard uses a
rigorous questionnaire system that can be continuously updated and adjusted as the organization
grows. The standard has 5 categories of impact: Community, Customers, Environment,
Governance and Workers, each with relevant subsections concerning stewardship, impact,
sustainability, and more. Gov Bloom LLC, its directors, officers, and owners have no governance
interests in the B Impact Assessment organization or any of its known subsidiaries.

CONCLUSION

Bloom had a productive 2024, focusing on public service impact and internal growth. We’re
particularly proud of our support for veterans, or research that contributed to meaningful
changes in child welfare policies, and our engagement with like-minded companies.

We share our work wherever we can in order to make our collective expertise publicly available to
the broader community. To learn more about our successes and learnings, review our past work
and case studies.
