## Services

THE CIVIC FORGE SOLUTION
High quality government affairs mitigates risks and creates opportunities for your business, and the time to bring that support onboard is almost always before you know you need it. 

The Status Quo Offers Two Options

For many businesses, these paths don’t hit the right balance of output quality and cost to deliver.

1. IN-HOUSE STAFF
Full-time, fully burdened staff regardless of actual work need
Restricted by the capacity and expertise of your hire(s)

2. TRADITIONAL CONSULTANTS
Fragmented across an array of costly providers
Operate at a distance from the problem, your mission, and you

OUR ANSWER:
In-house government affairs delivered from just outside the house.
