### What we aim to solve

SOURCE: Self-reported by organization

The Atlanta Beltline is one of the country's largest, most wide-ranging urban redevelopment programs, with a vision to be the catalyst for making Atlanta a global beacon for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable city life. A public-private partnership, ABP and Atlanta Beltline, Inc. (ABI) work together to develop infrastructure, grow thoughtful partnerships, and implement programs to ensure the Beltline yields equitable outcomes by helping people live, work, and thrive along it. These initiatives work together to create an ecosystem where residents and businesses can benefit from the economic and lifestyle opportunities the Beltline generates.

#### Atlanta Beltline Art

Atlanta Beltline Art celebrates the voices, experiences, and values of all Atlantans through the work of hundreds of visual artists, performers, and musicians along the corridor.

#### Volunteer Opportunities

The Atlanta Beltline Partnership is happy to accept groups of varying sizes to volunteer at any event or volunteer opportunity. We seek individual volunteers to help us execute annual community events and programs such as the Washington Park Jamboree, Beltline Race Series, Lantern Parade, and more. We also offer community groups and organizations an opportunity to participate in our “Adopt the Beltline” program, which plays a direct role in improving and maintaining segments of the Atlanta Beltline. Volunteers participate by assisting with litter control, invasive plant removal, and other beautification projects. Hours vary, and no expertise is needed.
