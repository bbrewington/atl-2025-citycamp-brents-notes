## Perplexity Response: Research Plan

Here is a tailored research plan to prepare for CityCamp Atlanta 2025, focusing on the intersection of data, AI, civic technology, and Atlanta’s pressing social needs. This plan targets city strategy, budget context, nonprofit landscape, and societal patterns, offering actionable starting points for idea generation and effective unconference pitching.

### City of Atlanta: Strategy and Budget

- The Atlanta Regional Commission’s 2025 goals are centered on **Livable Communities**, **Strategic Investments** in people and infrastructure, operational excellence in services, diverse stakeholder engagement, and an inclusive, innovative economy.[^1]
- The City’s FY2025 operating budget is \$2.75B. Department priorities involve **transportation, housing, asset management, public safety, technology, planning, and parks**.[^2][^3]
- Affordable housing funding is a dominant theme: Atlanta Housing’s \$533.9M FY2025 budget is designed to expand affordable options, deploy HUD funds effectively, and implement urgent housing strategies.[^4]
- Propel ATL’s 2025 Policy Agenda champions equitable, sustainable transportation with an emphasis on sidewalks, bike infrastructure, transit alternatives, integrated zoning for affordable transit-oriented development, and safety overhauls—especially in underinvested communities.[^5]


### Key Local Nonprofits and Civic Tech Partners

- **Civic Tech Atlanta** (501(c)(3), formerly Code for Atlanta) is a central organizing partner for CityCamp, focusing on inclusive, public-impact civic technology.[^6][^7][^8]
- **Hands On Atlanta**, Propel ATL, Park Pride, Livable Buckhead, West Atlanta Watershed Alliance, Wylde Center, Helping Mamas, Free Bikes 4 Kidz, Solidarity Food Pantry, and Out Of Hand Theatre are active in the civic space.[^9][^10]
- Previous initiatives by Civic Tech Atlanta included cleaning up nonprofit data, improving intake/reporting, and preparing organizations for technology-aided migration and analytics.[^10]


### Societal Patterns and Resonant Themes

- Atlanta grapples with pronounced **housing affordability, transit equity, public safety disparities, and legacy inequities in development**. Progress on infrastructure/streets projects often slows due to staff capacity and inequitable resource allocation.[^5]
- Federal funding uncertainties are increasing pressure on local innovation and collective action.[^6]
- Data and AI stand to unlock new approaches in participatory democracy (e.g., equitable budget visualizations, open voting engagement), social service access (predictive need mapping), and transparency (real-time dashboards for resource allocation and project tracking).[^10]
- Community resilience, climate adaptation, and public health (including food insecurity) are emergent needs addressed by civic partners.[^9][^10]


### Research Plan

#### 1. Strategy and Budget Review

- Analyze the Atlanta FY2025 budget and ARC’s work program for allocations to tech, equity, housing, and transportation.[^3][^1][^2][^4]
- Identify gaps where civic tech, data, or AI could drive efficiency, transparency, or inclusion.


#### 2. Nonprofit and Civic Tech Ecosystem Mapping

- Study recent Civic Tech Atlanta and Hands On Atlanta projects for inspiration and evidence of impact.[^7][^8][^9][^10]
- Engage with Propel ATL and other transportation/housing equity advocates for partnership or data-sharing possibilities.[^5]


#### 3. Societal Issue Scanning

- Collect data on affordable housing backlogs, transit coverage gaps, and outcomes disparities in different districts.
- Examine pandemic-era innovations (e.g., food insecurity maps, digital equity projects) for scalable, data-driven ideas.


#### 4. Pitch Ideation and Positioning

- Brainstorm projects that combine technical skills (AI, analytics, open data) with Atlanta’s civic needs:
    - Examples: transparent city spending dashboards, equitable project advocacy tools, civic engagement sentiment AI, data-powered resource matching for housing or food needs.
- If possible, offer to use or pilot tools/post CityCamp to ensure sustainability.


#### 5. Networking and Collaboration

- Reach out to Civic Tech Atlanta pre-event to identify needs, volunteer opportunities, or collaborative pitches.[^8][^7]
- Prepare to frame pitches around “enablement” for vulnerable communities, harm reduction, and sustainable public impact.[^10]

This approach will maximize alignment with CityCamp’s collaborative and grassroots ethos, ensuring any pitch is data-informed, locally relevant, and resonates with Atlanta’s 2025 priorities.
