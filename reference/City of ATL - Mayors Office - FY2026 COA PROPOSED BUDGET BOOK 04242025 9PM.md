THE HISTORY OF THE CITY OF ATLANTA

Atlanta  was  founded  in  1837  as  the  end  of  the  Western  &  Atlantic  railroad  line.  It  was  first  named
Marthasville in honor of the then Governor's daughter, nicknamed Terminus for its rail location, and then
changed soon after to Atlanta, the feminine of Atlantic � as in the railroad.  Today the fast-growing city
remains a transportation hub, not just for the country but also for the world. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta
International  Airport  is  the  nation's  busiest  in  daily  passenger  flights.  Direct  flights  to  Europe,  South
America,  and  Asia  have  made  metro  Atlanta  easily  accessible  to  the  more  than  1,000  international
businesses that operate in Atlanta and in more than 50 countries that have representation in the city
through consulates, trade offices, and chambers of commerce. The city has emerged as a banking center
and boasts the third largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the country.

Atlanta is the Capital city of the southeast, a city of the future with strong ties to its past.  Atlanta is the
soul of the south, and its heritage enhances the quality of life in a contemporary city. In the turbulent
60's, Atlanta was "the city too busy to hate." Moreover, today, in the 21st Century, Atlanta is the "city not
too busy to care."

For more than five decades, Atlanta has been linked to the civil rights movement. Civil Rights leaders
were  the  visionaries  who  saw  a  new  south,  a  new  Atlanta.  They  believed  in  peace,  and  they  made
monumental sacrifices for that peace; and, because of them, Atlanta became a fast-paced modern city,
which opened its doors to the 1996 Olympics.

Over  the  past  two  decades,  Atlanta  has  experienced  unprecedented  growth  �  the  city  population  is
estimated around a half-million, but the metro population has grown nearly 45%, from 4.2 million to 6.1
million  today.    A  good  measure  of  this  growth  is  the  ever-changing  downtown  skyline,  along  with
skyscrapers constructed in Midtown, Buckhead, and outer perimeter business districts.

Since the late 1970s dozens of dazzling skyscrapers designed by such luminaries as Philip Johnson, I. M.
Pei, and Marcel Breuer have reshaped the city's profile. Twenty-first century history, in Atlanta, is being
written.

THE HONORABLE ANDRE DICKENS

Andre Dickens is the 61st Mayor of Atlanta.

A  proud  native  of  Atlanta  and  a  product  of  Atlanta  Public  Schools,  Mayor
Dickens is focused on bringing opportunity and equity to the city that he loves.

Mayor  Dickens�  agenda  is  rooted  in  Moving  Atlanta  Forward,  through
improving public safety, increasing opportunities for the city�s young people,
empowering  neighborhoods,  and  investing  in  housing  and  combatting
homelessness, all while fostering a culture of integrity in the City.  As he shared
in his first State of the City address, his vision for Atlanta is:

One city with one bright future. A city of safe, healthy, connected neighborhoods
with an expansive culture of equity, empowering upward mobility and full participation for all residents,
embracing  youth  development,  and  an  innovative,  dependable  government  moving  Atlanta  forward,
together.

Mayor Dickens was sworn in as Mayor in January 2022. Early accomplishments include making the City�s
first-ever investment in early childhood education; the establishment of the Nightlife Division to address
establishments with a history of high crime; the re-establishment of the Pothole Posse to rapidly respond
to residents� reports; and leading the successful coalition to keep Atlanta whole in opposition to a de-
annexation effort.

Prior to his election as Mayor, Dickens served eight years as an at-large City Council member. He was an
entrepreneur for over a decade in both the private and nonprofit sectors and a leader in Atlanta�s tech
sector.  Mayor  Dickens  is  a  graduate  of  Mays  High  School  and  holds  a  bachelor�s  degree  in  chemical
engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology as well as a Master of Public Administration from
Georgia State University.

As the Post 3 At-Large City Council member from 2014 to 2021, Andre Dickens was a vocal legislative
leader  on  public  safety,  transportation,  affordable  housing,  workforce  development,  educational
opportunities for Atlanta Public Schools students, and seasoned citizens programming. He served as the
chairman of the Transportation Committee, providing oversight to city streets, bridges, sidewalks, paths,
and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world�s busiest airport.

Some  of  his  legislative  highlights  include:  creating  the  Department  of  Transportation,  sponsoring
legislation increasing annual salaries for Senior Patrol Officers, implementing a $15 per hour minimum
wage for city employees, establishing BeltLine Inclusionary Zoning for affordable housing, establishing
the Atlanta Youth Commission, setting aside a $40 million Housing Opportunity Bond, creating a joint
commission  between  City  Council  and  APS  board,  and  establishing  a  BeltLine  senior  housing  rehab
program. In 2017, he sponsored and helped launch the Teen �Midnight� Basketball League, a program
which includes workshops that help young men develop life skills and further their education.
Mayor  Dickens  previously  served  as  the  Chief  Development  Officer  for  TechBridge,  a  nonprofit  that
drives community impact by bringing affordable technology and business expertise to other nonprofit

15

organizations.  In  2018,  he  co-founded  the  Technology  Career  Program,  a  free  program  designed  to
prepare  unemployed  and  individuals  experiencing  disadvantage  in  the  work  field  for  a  career  in  the
growing  technology  job  market.  The  program  teaches  high  demand  technology  skills  while  helping
participants land jobs in IT departments across Atlanta.

Mayor Dickens also previously served as the Assistant Director of Outreach Initiatives for Georgia Tech�s
Office of Institute Diversity. He spearheaded Tech�s African-American Male Institute, which resulted in a
significant  increase  in  the  GPA  and  graduation  rate  among  Black  males.  He  also  managed  the  Focus
graduate  school  recruitment  program  and  the  Challenge  Program  that  helped  hundreds  of  students
successfully transition into college life each year.

Early in his career, Mayor Dickens worked as a sales engineer for DSM Engineering Plastics and became
the  youngest  and  first  Black  salesman  of  the  year.  At  the  age  of  28,  he  co-founded  City  Living  Home
Furnishings, which grew into a multi-million-dollar retail business with two locations. Mayor Dickens
ran the company for nine years until 2011.

Mayor Dickens has been a member of the Georgia Tech Alumni Board of Directors and is an alumnus of
Leadership Atlanta, Diversity Leadership Atlanta, United Way VIP, and Regional Leadership Institute. He
is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi, Fraternity, Inc.; deacon of New Horizon Baptist Church and has served
on the boards of the Atlanta BeltLine, Invest Atlanta, TechBridge and the Center for Civil and Human
Rights.

Mayor  Dickens  enjoys  spending  time  with  his  daughter,  experiencing  live  music,  attending  church
services, and traveling the world. He is an avid supporter of all of Atlanta�s sports teams.

HOW THE CITY COUNCIL WORKS

The Atlanta City Government is divided into three bodies: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
The  Council  serves  as  the  legislative  branch.  City  departments,  under  the  direction  of  the  Mayor,
constitute the executive branch and the Courts, the judicial branch.

The Legislative body, comprised of the Council, makes the laws that govern the city.  It is responsible for
the development of policies, which serve as operational standards, and establishes the parameters for
the administration of city government.  The Executive body carries out the laws that have been instituted
by the Council.  It is responsible for the day-to-day operations of city government.  The Judicial body has
jurisdiction and power to try and punish violators of the City Charter, city ordinances, and any other
violations as provided by law.

THE CITY CHARTER:
The  1974  Charter  resulted  in  many  changes  in  Atlanta  City  government.    Prior  to  its  adoption,  the
legislative body was called the Board of Aldermen and each alderman was elected citywide.  The 1974
charter changed the Board of Aldermen to the City Council; the vice-mayor to the president of the Council;
and established 12 Council members to be elected from individual districts and six at-large posts.  The
administration of the day-to-day operation of city government was transferred to the executive branch,
and legislative authority was vested in the Council.  This system allows the Council to maintain a strong
system of checks and balances.  A new charter was enacted in 1996 that reduced the representation of
Council to 12 districts and three at large posts and became effective January 1998.

ABOUT THE ATLANTA CITY COUNCIL
The president of the City Council is elected from the city at-large (citywide).  The Council consists of 15
members,  12  elected  from  single-member  districts  and  three  elected  at-large.    The  Council  president
presides at all meetings of the Council and votes in the case of a tie.  The president of Council appoints
chairs and members of the various committees, subject to rejection by a majority of the Council.  The
Council president exercises all powers and discharges all duties of the Mayor in case of a vacancy in that
office or during the disability of the Mayor.

Council  members  are  elected  to  four-year  terms  commencing  with  the  first  Monday  in  January.    The
current Council began its term January 2022. The members of the Council elect a president pro tempore
each  year  to  serve  a  one-year  term  beginning  with  the  first  meeting  in  January.    The  president  pro
tempore presides over the Council meetings in the president's absence.  Atlanta City Council members
are  paid  $72,360  annually.  The  Council  president  is  paid  $74,400  annually.    For  the  terms  of  office
beginning  January  2026,  City  Council  members�  salaries  will  increase  to  $99,930  and  the  Council
president�s  salary  will  increase  to  $103,250.  An  independent  committee  of  city  residents  determines
salaries.

Atlanta, Georgia, 30303

Dear President Shipman and Esteemed Members of the Atlanta City Council:

As the 61st Mayor of Atlanta, I proudly present the proposed Fiscal Year 2026 Budget for your consideration.
This  $3  billion-dollar  operating  budget  includes  $975.4  million  for  the  General  Fund,  which  shows  the
continued growth of our city with a 14% increase from the FY2025 Adopted Budget of $853.8M. It reflects
not  only  Atlanta�s  strong  fiscal  stewardship  but  also  our  shared  commitment  to  delivering  real  results,
expanding opportunity, and building a more equitable, safe, and inclusive community. This year comes with
a clear call to action. There is work to do, to continue advancing the City on behalf of our residents.

This proposed budget along with the $9.3 billion dollars for Capital funding represents over $12 billion of
impactful investments across the City�s many service areas, the employees who respond to the needs of our
more than 500,000 residents, and the diversity of services required of the nation�s sixth-largest metropolitan
area. I want to extend my gratitude to Chief Financial Officer Mohamed Balla and the entire Department of
Finance for their leadership and diligence in crafting this comprehensive budget proposal. The collective
efforts of this team in partnership with the many leaders of my administration, ensure we are making strategic,
value-driven investments to Move Atlanta Forward.

The FY2026 budget focuses on key initiatives that are central to our mission:

Public Safety
We are further investing in the ongoing development of our outstanding first responders, exemplified by the
Public Safety Training Center, millions invested in needed apparatus and equipment, an enhanced pension,
and increased wages. This commitment is a part of our One Safe City strategy, which has already contributed
to a notable reduction in violent crime citywide. Together we are making key investments in city infrastructure
� including new police vehicles, fire ladder trucks, and major improvements to municipal facilities such as
the Courts and City Hall. These investments show that the City is committed to ensuring our residents both
feel and are safe.

Youth Engagement
Our  continued  commitment  to  programs  such  as  Midnight  Basketball,  the  Mayor�s  Summer  Youth
Employment  Program,  and  the  expansion  of  Atlanta�s  At-Promise  Centers  provide  safe,  enriching
environments that foster growth and opportunity for our talented young people. Supporting Atlanta�s future
leaders, workforce, and citizens is a key tenant of my broader goal to ensure that Atlanta is the best place in
the nation to raise a child.

Infrastructure
We are making strategic investments to strengthen Atlanta�s infrastructure highlighted by the Moving Atlanta
Forward initiative, but that is just one of our many investments. Major improvements to municipal facilities,
including the Municipal Court and City Hall, expand these efforts to improve the quality of life of our citizens
and  access  to  city  services.  These  upgrades  will  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  our  service  delivery  and
reinforce our commitment to being A City Built for the Future.

City Personnel
Our employees are the heart of this government. This budget includes necessary investments in frontline
workers, public safety personnel, and dedicated City Staff. These investments ensure competitive pay and
compensation appropriate for team members who work tirelessly to keep Atlanta running.

Affordable Housing
As I approach the end of my first term, I am proud that we remain on time and ahead of schedule in our goal
to deliver or preserve 20,000 units of affordable housing by 2030. Housing is foundational to a community�s
health � and simply put, Atlanta doesn�t have enough of it. Funding mechanisms established in this budget
will ensure the successful completion of this objective, reinforcing our collective effort to create
A City of Opportunity for All.

This budget reflects our collective values, priorities, and our belief in Atlanta. I am committed to a whole of
government  approach,  where  every  resource  available  to  us  is  utilized  to  improve  services,  support  our
continued growth, and ensure access to City services, all while lowering the burden on our tax base. Atlanta
is a group project where real progress happens when government, businesses, nonprofits, and community
members come together around a shared vision.

Our collective vision, stern financial stewardship, diversity in service delivery, and flat-out hard work have
resulted in a combination of innovative service delivery and a best-in-class AAA bond rating benefitting our
residents and business community alike. With this FY2026 Budget, we take another meaningful step toward
our shared vision of safe, healthy, connected neighborhoods and an inclusive economy that empowers upward
mobility for all.

Thank  you  for  your  continued  partnership  and  commitment  to  Moving  Atlanta  Forward,  together,  for
everyone.

Sincerely,

Mayor Andre Dickens

The Honorable Doug Shipman, President
Members of City Council
Atlanta City Council
55 Trinity Avenue SE
Atlanta, GA 30303

Dear President Shipman and members of the Atlanta City Council:

As  we  continue  to  advance  initiatives  related  to  public  safety,  affordable  housing,  and  infrastructure,  we  remain
mindful of the financial landscape shaped in part by temporary federal tariffs. In planning for the future, our focus
will be on maintaining current operational levels while streamlining financial resources wherever possible.

This  approach  will  require  departments  to  prioritize  efficiency  and  find  ways  to  do  more  with  less.  These  key
priorities�public safety, housing, and infrastructure�will remain at the forefront as we continue to exercise fiscal
discipline across all city operations.

To uphold our commitment to responsible financial stewardship, we have implemented several measures, including
the reinstatement of the Vacancy Review Board. This board plays a critical role in evaluating whether vacant positions
are  essential  to  fill,  ensuring  we  remain  thoughtful  and  deliberate  in  our  hiring  practices.  We  require  that  all
departments continue to focus on maintaining operational effectiveness, maximizing the use of existing resources, and
adhering strictly to approved budgets. Together, through shared commitment and prudent decision-making, we can
navigate these challenges and continue to serve the residents of Atlanta effectively.

The  current  operating  budget  for  the  City  of  Atlanta  stands  at  $3.0  billion.  This  total  reflects  all  funding  sources,
including but not limited to the General Fund, Aviation, Watershed Management, and Solid Waste Services.

Below, you will find a table that provides a detailed breakdown of each funding source.

It  is  important  to  note  that  all  revenues  are  budgeted  in  alignment  with  projected  expenses,  ensuring  a  balanced
approach  to  financial  planning  and  resource  allocation.  This  alignment  reinforces  our  commitment  to  fiscal
responsibility and long-term sustainability.

The City of Atlanta�s FY2026 General Fund Budget totals $975 million. This fund supports the City�s core operations
and  is  sustained  by  a  diverse  mix  of  revenue  sources.  Major  contributors  include  property  taxes,  sales  taxes,  and
hotel/motel taxes, which together form the foundation of the General Fund�s financial structure.

As part of this proposal, the City is pursuing a proactive financial strategy aimed at reducing property taxes, lowering
debt  obligations,  and  strengthening  long-term  financial  stability.  By  reallocating  savings  from  bond  levies  and
optimizing general obligation debt, reduce the City�s overall debt burden, generate additional property tax revenue for
the General Fund, and deliver meaningful tax relief to residents
Below is a breakdown of these major revenue sources.

As we submit this proposed budget, we remain committed to closely monitoring all revenue sources and  changing
economic indicators. Our goal is to continue practicing sound financial management while maintaining the highest
standards of fiscal responsibility and accountability. Through prudent oversight and strategic planning, we will ensure
the City's resources are used efficiently and in the best interest of all Atlantans.

Sincerely,

Mohamed Balla

end  of  the  current  fiscal  period.  Expenditures
generally are recorded when a liability is incurred,
as under accrual accounting.

However,  principal  and  interest  on  general  long?
term  debt,  compensated  absences,  claims  and
judgments,  and  workers�

recorded only when payment is due. General capital

governmental funds. Proceeds of general long?term
debt  and  acquisitions  under  capital  leases  are
reported as other financing sources. The full accrual
basis  of  accounting  is  used  for  proprietary  funds.
The  difference  between  the  fiscal  year  used  for
financial  reporting  and  the  budget  period
is
primarily due to the timing of revenues based on the
modified accrual basis of accounting, project length

binding upon the City Council without any action
of approval or disapproval.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
The  Chief  Financial  Officer  must  furnish  each
member of the council a complete, detailed, and
written copy of the proposed annual budget five
days prior to the meeting at which the budget is
submitted to the City Council for adoption.

OPERATING BUDGET POLICIES
Annual  budgets  are  adopted  for  the  General,
Special  Revenue,  and  Debt  Service  Funds  with
the level of legal budgetary control established at
the department level by the City Council. The City
is required to adopt a balanced budget each year
and  maintain  budgetary  controls  to  ensure
compliance  with  legal  provisions  of  the  annual
appropriated budget approved by the Mayor and
the  City  Council.  The  amounts  of  anticipated
revenues and appropriated expenditures for the
annual budget are controlled by the City Charter
and  various  ordinances  adopted  by  the  City
Council.  Appropriations  for  capital  projects  are
adopted  by  the  City  Council  principally  on  an
individual  basis  when  the  project  is  initially
approved.

The  legally  adopted  budget  is  on  a  modified
accrual  basis.  The  modified  accrual  basis  of
accounting  is  also  used  for  reporting  financial
statements  associated  with  the  governmental
fund.  Revenues  are  recognized  as  soon  as  they
are both measurable and available. Revenues are
available  when  they  are  collectable  within  the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay
for  the  liabilities  of  the  current  period.  For  this
purpose,  the  City  considers  revenues  to  be

pillars  �  each  designed  to  address  long-term  initiatives,  drive  equitable  growth,  and  enhance  the
overall quality of life for all Atlantans.

These goals  were  developed  through  a collaborative  process  led  by  Mayor Dickens  and  the City�s
Executive  Leadership  Team.  They  emerged  from  a  combination  of  resident  feedback,  data-driven
assessments, and citywide departmental input. This inclusive approach ensured that the strategic
direction reflects the needs, priorities, and aspirations of Atlanta�s diverse communities. The Mayor
and executive leaders worked closely to refine the goals, align them with long-term planning efforts,
and ensure cross-departmental coordination for effective implementation. The mayor�s agenda was
built on four pillars noted below.

A CITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL

We strive to provide high-quality, responsive, and equitable services that meet A City of Opportunity
for All: We want to ensure that all Atlantans share in Atlanta�s growth and prosperity. We invest in our
young  people,  care  for  the  most  vulnerable,  and  create  opportunities  for  all  to  advance.  We  are
investing in quality housing for all, by building 20,000 new or preserved units of affordable housing
and making homelessness brief, rare and non-reoccurring. We�re investing in the workforce, so that
all Atlantans can access jobs in our growing economy.

ONE SAFE CITY

The One Safe City plan is a balanced approach that mobilizes the entire government and engages our
partners, communities and residents. It addresses the root causes of crime as well as targets gangs,
drugs, illegal guns and repeat offenders. One Safe City is working to keep all our neighborhoods safe
and welcoming for residents, visitors and businesses.

A CITY BUILT FOR THE FUTURE

We are making smart investments to improve Atlanta�s existing infrastructure while developing and
implementing new infrastructure projects to meet the needs of today and prepare for the needs of the
future.  From  new  investments  in  transportation  that  build  a  safe,  equitable  mobility  network
throughout Atlanta to resilience and sustainability actions that can be taken at the local level to combat
the global climate crisis, we believe investing in infrastructure is essential to foster economic growth
and improve Atlanta�s competitiveness on the world stage.

EFFECTIVE AND ETHICAL GOVERNMENT

The ability of the City of Atlanta to deliver on the Moving Atlanta Forward agenda rests on the quality,
efficiency  and  integrity  of  our  government.  The  Dickens  Administration  is  building  a  government
designed to deliver for our residents, businesses and visitors. That means transparency, efficiency and
accountability for City actions and decision-making. It also means being responsive to residents� needs
and providing timely, reliable information. We are committed to building the trust of our residents
and other stakeholders as we work to solve problems and advance opportunity in our city.

FUND STRUCTURE

The City uses funds and account groups to  report
its
its  financial  position  and  the  results  of
to
is  designed
operations.  Fund  accounting
demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial
management by segregating transactions related to
certain  government  functions  or  activities.  The
fund  types  established  by  the  City  are  described
below and throughout this document.

GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS
The  Governmental  Funds  group  is  one  of  three
fund groups in the City's budget.  The funds in this
Fund group, account for those transactions that are
supported by general taxation, intergovernmental
grants, special assessments, and other sources that
are not restricted to enterprise operations or held
in a trustee capacity.

� The General Fund is the City's primary operating
fund. It accounts for all financial transactions of the
City, except those required  to be accounted for in
another fund.
� The Debt Service Fund is used to account for the
accumulation  of  resources  and  the  subsequent
disbursement  of  such  resources  to  pay  principal
and  interest  on  long?term  debt  of  the  City  (other
than certificates of participation and the debt of the
tax allocation districts funds and enterprise funds).
Bond  ordinances  require  the  City  to  account  for
debt  service  transactions  in  separate  funds,  to
restrict the flow of cash between such funds, and to
comply with various other covenants.
� The  Trust  Fund  accounts  for  assets  held  by  the
City  in  a  trustee  capacity.    A  portion  of  the  trust
funds listed were established by trust agreements
and are held for a specific purpose.
� The  Special  Assessment  Fund  accounts  for  the
accumulation  and  expenditure  of  resources  for
various  public  improvements  such  as  sidewalks,
curbs  and  gutters,  which  are  financed  through
assessments to individual property owners.
� The Special Revenue Funds  account for activities
carried out by the City under the terms of certain
intergovernmental  grants.  It  accounts  for  the
proceeds of special revenue sources that are legally
restricted to expenditures for specified purposes.

PROPRIETARY FUNDS
Proprietary Funds distinguish operating  revenues
and expenses from non?operating items. Operating
revenues  and  expenses  generally  result
from
providing,  producing,  and  delivering  goods  and
services  in  connection  with  a  proprietary  fund�s
principal  ongoing  operations.  Operating  expenses
for  enterprise  funds  include  the  cost  of  sales  and
services, administrative expenses, and depreciation
of  capital  assets.  All  revenues  and  expenses  not
meeting  this  definition  are  reported  as  non?
operating revenues and expenses.

� Enterprise  Funds  are  designed  to  be  self?
supporting.  The  Department  of  Watershed
for  all
Management  (DWM)  Fund  accounts
activities  associated  with  the  provision  and
management of clean water, wastewater and storm
water  systems,  and  water  pollution  control
services  to  individuals,  organizations  and  other
governmental  units  within  and  around  the  City.
The Department of Aviation (DOA) Fund accounts
for  the  activities  of  the  William  B.  Hartsfield  ?
Maynard H. Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Other  enterprise
include  Solid  Waste
Services, and the City Plaza Fund.
� The  Internal  Service  Funds  account  for  the
activities of Motor Transport (Fleet) Services, and
Group  Insurance  transactions  related  to  the
provision  of  life,  accident,  and  medical  insurance
benefits through outside insurance companies   for
permanent employees and retirees of the City.

funds

FIDUCIARY   FUNDS
Fiduciary Funds are used to report assets held in
trust or agency capacity for others and therefore,
cannot  be  used  to  support  the  governments�
programs. Since the pension trust fund and agency
funds cannot be used for governmental programs;
they  are  not  budgeted  but  are  included  in  our
audited financial statements.

� The  Agency  Fund  accounts  for  various  taxes  and
other receipts held in escrow for individuals, outside
organizations,  other  governments  and/or  other
funds.

CAPITAL FUND STRUCTURE

All  other  funds  (listed  below)  are  considered
Capital  Funds  and  were  established  for  a  specific
purpose, are non?recurring in nature or considered

�  Grant Funds

�  Bond Sinking Funds
�  Special Assessment Funds
�  Trust Fund
�  Agency Fund (Non?budgetary)
� Pension Trust Funds (Non-budgetary)

The  citywide  fund  structure  can  be  divided  into
two  areas:  operating  and  capital.  The  operating
budget is defined as the annual budget for routine,
ongoing activities of an organizational unit. While
the  capital  budget  is  typically  established  for
specific  projects,  such  as  capital  projects,  grant
funded  projects,  and  other  activities  of  a  non-
recurring nature.

OPERATING FUND STRUCTURE

The General Fund is the principal operating fund of
the City and is used to account for all activities of
the City not otherwise accounted for by a specified
fund. It is also the largest of the City�s funds and is
comprised  of  mostly  general  tax  revenues  that
provide  basic  city  services,  such  as  Police,  Fire  &
Rescue, and Parks services.

Enterprise Funds are designed to be self?supported
by  user  charges  or  fees.  The  Department  of
Aviation,  City  Plaza,  Solid  Waste  Services,  and
Water  &  Wastewater  Management  are  accounted
for  as  enterprise  funds.  Separate  fund  accounts
within each of the enterprise funds are required to
be  maintained  in  accordance  with  various  bond
ordinances:

�  The  Aviation  Revenue  Fund  accounts  for  the
accumulation of income and disbursement of funds
associated with the operation and construction of
International
the  Hartsfield?Jackson  Atlanta
Airport.  These  funds  generate  income  primarily
from leases and use agreements with airlines and
with  various  concessionaires  within  the  terminal
facility and parking operations.

�  The  City  Plaza  Fund  accounts  for  the  revenues,
expenses  and  bond  proceeds  incurred  from  the
operation of the City Plaza Project. A portion of the
bond proceeds will be used to reimburse the City
for  the  acquisition  costs  of  the  City  Plaza  Project.
Revenues for the fund are derived from rents from
residents, tenants, and parking fees.

� Revenues generated from the Solid Waste Services
Fund  are  from  user  fees  or  charges  for  specific
services  provided.  This  fund  should  be  self?
sufficient  and  charge  adequate  fees  to  pay  for  the
level  of  service  provided.  The  primary  sources  of
revenues  are  garbage  pick?up/disposal,  recycling,
street sweeping and rubbish collection.

factors  will

Due  to  the  above  average  growth  in
employment and population, the Atlanta
MSA�s  housing  market  is  stronger  than
most  other  large  US  MSAs.  The  MSA�s
housing  market  is  the  nation�s  fifth
largest when measured in terms of total
housing  units.  Population,  job  growth,
and a scarcity of listings will be tailwinds
for  Atlanta�s housing  industry, but high
mortgage  rates,  high  home  prices,
decreased affordability, and a scarcity of
construction workers will be headwinds.
As of the third quarter of 2024, Atlanta�s
home  prices  were  67  percent  above
their  pre-  pandemic  recession  peak
levels.  The  most  recently  posted  year-
over-year  price  increase  �  between
2024 Q3 and 2023 Q3 � was 5 percent.
Based on traditional metrics, the metro
area�s  homes  are  overvalued,  but
despite  that  overvaluation  we  expect
home  prices  to  hold  steady  in  2025.

The Atlanta MSA is highly specialized in
transportation,  logistics,  warehousing,
and  wholesale  trade,  with  employment
concentrated in these inherently cyclical
industries.  Atlanta�s role as a high-tech
inland
transportation,
for
distribution,  and  warehousing  will
increase
The
connectivity  of  Georgia�s  ports  to  the
interstate  system,  rail,  and  air  cargo  is
excellent.  Among  major  US  metros,
Atlanta  is  a  low-cost,  low-risk  place  to
operate  a  warehouse.  A  substantial
amount
high-tech
of
warehouse/distribution  space  is  under
construction,  which  will  provide  the
capacity for additional growth of Atlanta
transportation and logistics cluster.

Compared  to  other  large  metro  areas,
Atlanta  depends  primarily  on  domestic
rather than global markets. For example,
exports  account  for  only  5.9  percent  of
the  area�s  GDP.  Although  the  MSA
therefore  is  not  overly  dependent  on
export markets, immigrants account for
14.3  percent  of  the  MSA�s  population,
ranking  85th  among  all  MSAs.  Thus,
more  restrictive  US  immigration  laws
and/or  stricter  enforcement  of  existing
immigration  laws  have  hurt  Atlanta�s
economy.  In  the  short  term,  we  do  not
expect  that  dynamic  to  worsen.  The
Atlanta MSA�s main long-term weakness
is an overburdened infrastructure.

accessible

Compared  to  other  large  metropolitan
areas with strong links to global markets
the costs of doing business in the Atlanta
MSA  are  low  �  93  percent  of  the  US
average.  Companies  and  nonprofit
organizations looking to lower costs will
continue to relocate to Atlanta. Access to
workers, especially skilled labor, is vital
to  business  success.    Despite  the  limit

realistically
workers,
companies  are  attracted  to  Atlanta  due
to the large and diverse pool of workers.
The pool of talent is broad and deep for
occupations
that  require  a  college
degree as well as for occupations that do
not require college degrees. In addition,
the  high  concentration  of  colleges  and
universities  ensures  a  large  supply  of
experienced
faculty,  newly  minted
college  graduates,  and  student  interns.
Moreover,  Atlanta  is  the  nation�s  most
affordable  city  for  remote  workers.  In
2025,  the  area�s  labor  force  will  grow
more  slowly  than  in  2024,  but  faster
than that of the nation.

The  combination  of  low  business  costs,

outperform  most  US  metros  when  it
comes  to  broad-based  business  startup
rates. Less positively, stricter issuance of

to  attract  international  talent.  This  is  a
headwind  for  the  growth  of  Atlanta�s
high-technology industries.

area�s  hospitality

Due  to  Atlanta�s  long-time  focus  on
business  rather  than  leisure  travel  the
metro
industry
struggled  to  fully  recover  from  the
pandemic-recession.
the
pandemic,  Atlanta  was  the  sixth  most-
visited city by U.S. visitors � behind only
Orlando in the South. That high ranking

  Prior

to

89

was  mostly  due  to  Atlanta�s
large
industry,
meetings  and  convention
which  focused  primarily  on  business
travelers.  The  metro  Atlanta  market
ranks seventh among US cities in terms
of  its  inventory  of  hotel  rooms.  The
area�s  high  reliance  on  business  travel
was  a  major  deterrent  to  economic
recovery,  but  at  this  point  low-cost
virtual travel is baked into the industry�s
baseline  level  of  activity.  The  business
travel  industry  will  contribute  more  to
the  area�s  economy  in  2025  than  in
2024.

Leisure  and  business  travelers  have
returned to the skies. Increasing activity
at  Hartsfield-Jackson
International
Airport will support Atlanta�s economic
growth.  Planned  improvements  at  the
airport  bode  well  for  Atlanta�s  future
growth. In most years, the airport is the
world�s  busiest  for  passenger  traffic.  It
has  excellent  access  to  mass  transit.
Extreme  weather  events  capable  of
shutting down the airport are rare. The
airport makes the Atlanta area an ideal

headquarters  due  to
and
number  of  direct  domestic

economy

Given  the  federal  budget  situation,  one
major long-term plus for Atlanta is that
the metro area is not very dependent on
federal  government  jobs.  The  Atlanta
MSA�s  only  sizable  federal  employer  is
the  CDC  �  about  8,400  employees.
Federal, state, and local government jobs
combined  account  for  only  about  11
percent  of  total  employment  in  metro
Atlanta  versus  14  percent  for  the  state
and  15  percent  for  the  nation.  Thus,
eventual  restructuring  of  the  public-
sector  should  be  less  problematic  for
Atlanta�s overall  economic  growth than
for  growth  elsewhere  in  Georgia  or  the
nation.  Another
reason  Atlanta�s
economy  will  grow  faster  than  the
favorable
national
demographics.  Net  domestic  migration
ensures
the  Atlanta  MSA�s
population  expands  about  twice  as  fast
as  that  of  the  nation,  which  is  quite  an
accomplishment  for  one  of  the  nation�s
largest  metro  areas.  By  population,  the
Atlanta  MSA  ranks  fifth  among  all  US
MSAs.  The  main  sources  of  people
moving  to  the  Atlanta  MSA  are  New
York,  Los  Angeles,  Gainesville,  Chicago.
Lauderdale,  Miami,  Athens,
Fort
Orlando,  Washington  DC,  and  Tampa.
The  age  structure  of  the  Atlanta  MSA�s
population favors economic growth with
larger  than  average  proportions  of  Gen
Z, Millennials, and Gen X and lower than
average  proportions  of  Baby  Boomer
generations.
and
Educational  attainment  exceeds  the

however,  is  that  foreign  net  migration
will be much lower than a decade ago.

The  City's  Department  of  Finance  -  Office  of

Forecasting  Center  &  Andrew  Young  School  of
Public  Policy  at  Georgia  State  University,

Revenue Anticipations

The FY2025 General Fund Revenue Forecast is
$961  million  and  is  expected  to  surpass  the
amount approved by the Budget Commission in
June 2024.

The proposed FY2026 General Fund Revenue is
anticipated to be $975 million.

The City Finance team anticipates that property
tax revenues for 2025 will continue to grow in
FY2026.  This  growth  is  expected  to  result
mainly  from  taxable  market-based  increases
allowed  by  the  passage  of  HB820  and  new
construction.

The  proposed  FY2026  budget  also  includes  a
one  mill  increase  to  the  operating  levy  and  a
corresponding decrease to the debt levy of 1.03
mill, reducing the overall mill rate to 11.37 mills
established  during  budget  adoption.  It  also
retains the 0.67 operating mill rate increase for
Solid Waste funding approved in FY2023.

As this Proposed Budget was being developed,
the City had not yet received the 2025 tax digest
values  from  the  County  Tax  Assessor�s  offices,
which  are  expected  to  support  an  increase  in
property  tax  revenues.  The  City  relies  on
independent  economic
historical  data  and
sources  like  the  Case-Shiller  Index,  a  national
housing  price  index,  to  determine  property
valuation trends and estimates.

Property tax revenue constitutes approximately
40%  of  General  Fund  revenue  and  has  been
growing  since  2014  due  to  an  improved  real
estate  market.  The  City  continues  to  estimate
property  tax  revenue  growth  conservatively.
Additional  details  on  Property  Tax  revenue
assumptions  are  provided  later  in  the  trend
narrative. Sales tax revenue accounts for about
16% of General Fund revenues.

Sales tax revenue remains elastic, with greater
than expected receipts due to high inflation and
the costs of goods sold.  The lodging market, a
key  driver  for  hotel/motel  tax  revenues,  is
recovering slowly as business travel returns, yet
remains  crucial  to  the  City's  economic  health.
Additional insights are available in the Selig and
other reports under the hotel/motel section.

The  proposed  FY2026  General  Fund  Revenue
Budget  aligns  with  City  Charter  requirements,
and the Finance team exercises fiscal discipline
in revenue forecasting.  Additionally, the senior
management team monitors monthly Budget vs.
Actual revenue to adjust forecasts and maintain
financial stability.

A summation of total revenues within this major category and a breakdown of some of the key revenue
contributors within the category are as follows:

Current Year Property Taxes: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 375,788,039 (1)
The  City  of  Atlanta  imposes  a  tax  on  real  and  personal  property,  with  revenues  derived  from  the
millage rate and assessed values in the tax digest. The first year of  tax digest growth following the
Great Recession was in 2013. The 2024 Atlanta gross tax digest, which is the summation of all property
values in the city, marked the twelfth consecutive year of positive valuation growth. The 2024 Atlanta
net tax digest, accounting for values less tax exemptions, increased by 6.6% compared to the 2023 net
tax digest.

The city's proposed property tax budget shows an increase due to a 1 mill rise in the operating levy,
offset  by  a  1.03  mill  reduction  in  the  debt  levy.  Additionally,  the  Residential,  Commercial,  and
Industrial real estate sectors continue to grow steadily in valuation thanks to positive reassessments
and new construction.

To reduce tax burdens from market valuation increases, the General Assembly passed HB 820 in 2019,
approved by Atlanta citizens via referendum. This created a floating exemption, allowing the city to
retain  2.6%  reassessment  growth  and  new  construction  growth  without  additional  hearings  or
notices. The mayor approved an 8.52 general operations tax rate for FY 2025. The FY 2026 proposed
budget includes a 9.52 mill tax rate and maintains a 0.67 solid waste rate from FY 2023. The collection
rate assumption is 99%, consistent with historical rates.

The Selig report indicates, �Although traditional metrics indicate that the homes in the metro area are
overvalued, we anticipate that home prices will remain stable in 2025. This stability in home prices is
expected  to  sustain  spending  on  home  renovations,  repairs,  and  improvements.  Atlanta�s  housing
market is fundamentally strong. In 2025, the above-average population growth driven by robust net
migration, along with above-average job growth�particularly in high-paying jobs�and low vacancy
rates will support the housing market in Atlanta. The long-term outlook for the metro area�s housing
industry is more favorable than the short-term forecast.�

96Intangible Recording Taxes: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 4,676,922 (1)
The intangible recording tax is due and payable on each instrument securing one or more long-term
notes at the rate of $1.50 for each $500 or fraction thereof of the face amount of all notes secured by
real  property.  The  maximum  tax  on  a  single  instrument  is  $25,000.    Examples  include  mortgages,
deeds to secure debt bonds for title, or any other real estate security instrument that gives the lender
a resource to be used if the principal obligation is not paid. The Intangible Recording Tax revenue is
anticipated to increase slightly above the prior year�s budget amount due to rising interest rates and
the cost of borrowing.

Real Estate Transfer Tax: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 2,398,366 (1)
The real estate transfer tax in Atlanta is $1 for the first $1,000 and 0.10 cents for each additional $100
on any property transaction. This tax increases buyers' costs and reduces sellers' profits, which can
decrease market activity. Unlike property and sales taxes paid by property owners and consumers,
only real estate buyers and sellers pay this tax. It is generally based on the agreed sale price. A slight
revenue increase is expected due to rising housing prices.

These two revenue sources are impacted by trends in the housing market.  And, the Selig report states,
�Atlanta's housing market is stronger than most large US cities due to above-average employment and
population  growth.  Atlanta  ranks  fifth  among  total  housing  units.  Its  housing  industry  will  benefit
from job growth, population increase, and limited listings but faces challenges from high mortgage
rates, home prices, reduced affordability, and a shortage of construction workers.

Other Taxes: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 5,775,220 (1)
This category consists  of Prior Year  Property  Taxes,  Penalties  &  Interest,  and  Payments In  Lieu of
Taxes (PILOT).  The Other Taxes revenue growth is anticipated to be in line with the prior year.

PUBLIC UTILITY, ALCOHOL BEVERAGE & OTHER TAXES
This major revenue category  consists of  various  revenue sources  including  current  and  prior  year
public utility taxes, motor vehicle & title ad valorem taxes, state railroad ad valorem tax, public utility
franchise  tax,  insurance  premium  tax,  alcohol  beverage,  and  by-the-drink  taxes,  and  interest  &
penalties.

A summation of total revenues within this major category and a breakdown of some of the key revenue
contributors within the category are as follows:

Public Utility Franchise Fee: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation   - $ 54,692,350 (2)
This category covers franchise fees for electric, gas, cable, and telecommunication companies. Georgia
Power pays annually between January and February based on a percentage of gross receipts and have
greatly impacted the trajectory of these revenues. The Telecommunications Act of 2008 capped the

97municipal compensation at 3% of local service revenues, reducing the City's income in this category.
Revenue is expected to grow in FY2026.

Alcohol Tax: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 23,022,790 (2)
Wholesale distributors pay a .22 cent per liter alcohol tax, and patrons of city alcohol establishments
face a 3% tax-by-the-drink. Alcohol tax revenue and consumption are expected to rise with upcoming
FIFA  Club  &  World  Cup  matches,  influencing  the  FY2026  proposed  budget.  Normally,  alcohol
consumption remains inelastic to price or income changes.

Insurance Premium Tax: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 47,107,479 (2)
The  State  of  Georgia  levies  a  2.25%  tax  on  gross  direct  premiums  from  all  insurance  companies
operating within the state. This tax is paid to the Georgia Department of Insurance. The City's share
depends on its population relative to other cities and the state. Revenue in this category is expected
to rise next year due to favorable population trends and higher insurance costs in the Atlanta area.

Other Taxes: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 22,301,702 (2)
This category includes revenue from motor vehicle taxes, public utility taxes, and title ad valorem. The
anticipated increase in FY2026 is primarily due to higher public utility property taxes.

(2) This category includes Public Utility Franchise Fee, Alcohol Tax, Insurance Premium Tax, and Other Taxes.

LOCAL OPTION SALES TAX (LOST)
Local option sales tax is a major revenue source for the City and is imposed on the purchase, sale,
rental, storage, use, or consumption of tangible personal property and related services.  Proceeds from
this  tax  are  collected  by  the  Georgia  Department  of  Revenue  and  disbursed  to  the  county  and
municipalities  based  on  a  negotiated  allocation  between  Fulton  County  and  the  cities  within  the
county.  Atlanta's 1% LOST share is 39.8476% in 2025, 39.1895% in 2026, and will decline slightly
until it stabilizes from 2030 to 2032 due to negotiated adjustments.

FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation:
Sales tax has traditionally been sensitive to changing economic conditions due to its close correlation
with local retail sales activity, employment rates, and personal income levels. Despite this sensitivity,
sales tax has consistently outperformed expectations and is projected to continue its upward trend in
FY2026. This growth is primarily attributed to the rising cost of goods and services in the current high
inflation environment. Additionally, sales tax revenue is expected to increase due to the upcoming
FIFA Club & World Cup matches.

A summation of total revenues within this major category and a breakdown of some of the key revenue
contributors within this category are as follows:

General Business/License Tax: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $73,556,893 (3)
The general business/license tax, also known as the occupational tax, applies to all entities conducting
business in the City. The tax is calculated based on two criteria: 1) estimated gross revenue and 2)
number of employees. The gross revenue amount is based on the prior year tax returns and financial
statements.  This  tax  is  closely  linked  to  corporate  income  and  employment  levels.  The  FY2026
proposed budget anticipates growth in the next fiscal year due to additional revenues from increased
collection efforts.

Building Permits: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 39,735,694 (3)
Building Permits account for the collection of income and disbursement of funds associated with the
operation  of  all  building  permit  activity.  The  Building  Permits  Fund,  which  was  established  in
November 2011 as an enterprise fund was closed in FY2017. The revenues from the Building Permits
fund are now a part of the General Fund. The  FY2026 Building Permits proposed budget reflects a
slight decrease in the next fiscal year. The Selig report states, �interest-sensitive sectors, such as real
estate development, will not contribute too much to economic growth in 2025.�

This  revenue  summation  noted  above  contains  the  revenues  from  the  various  types  of  building
permits and is comprised of building, plumbing, electrical, and HVAC permits.

Other Licenses/Permits: FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation - $ 24,257,846 (3)
This category contains all remaining revenues in the license/permits major revenue category except
for the building permits. These revenue sources include alcohol, professional, financial, and insurance
related licenses and other permits for Police, Fire, and Atlanta Department of Transportation (right-
of-way, sidewalk closure, parking, and driveway aprons). This proposed budget is tied to residential
and commercial development and reflects consistent collections over the next fiscal year. Revenues
within this category also correlate to infrastructure investments and the hospitality related sectors.

 (3) This category includes General Business/ License Tax, Building Permits, and Other Licenses/Permits.

99OTHER REVENUES

The  City  of  Atlanta  allocates  a  portion  of  general  services  costs  such  as  purchasing,  accounting,
budgeting,  personnel  administration,  and  certain  other  indirect  costs  based  on  allocation
methodology determined by an independent cost allocation plan.

101FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation:
This revenue is tied to activity within the lodging and hospitality related sectors. The proposed budget
reflects the expectation of growth in this revenue from the FIFA Club and World Cup matches.

The  Selig  report  highlights  that,  �Atlanta�s  hospitality  industry  has  struggled  to  recover  from  the
pandemic due to its focus on business rather than leisure travel. Before the pandemic, Atlanta was the
sixth most-visited U.S. city, mainly because of its large meetings and convention sector. The metro
area ranks seventh in the U.S. for hotel room inventory. Heavy reliance on business travel hindered
economic  recovery,  but  virtual  travel  is  now  a  standard  practice.  The  business  travel  industry  is
expected to contribute more to Atlanta's economy in 2025 than in 2024.

The Federal Reserve Bank Beige book dated January 2025 states, �Travel and tourism activity increased
at a moderate pace in recent weeks. Many industry contacts reported stronger holiday travel than last
year.  Some  hotels  noted  room  rates  were  down  slightly,  but  many  reported  strong  bookings  and
increased revenue. Cruising activity, as well as business and group travel, remained strong."

CBRE Q4 report states �Looking towards 2025, Atlanta RevPAR is expected to grow 2.7%.  Occupancy
is forecast to remain at 66.8%, while average room rates are projected to increase 2.7%. Revenue is
expected to continue to climb in 2025.�

PILOT AND FRANCHISE FEES (WATERSHED)
This major revenue category consists of Watershed Pilot and Franchise Fee revenues derived from a
5% franchise fee levied on gross water and sewer revenues on all active accounts and a city millage
rate levied on Department of Watershed real property.

The Selig report predicts, �That job growth in Atlanta will outpace the national average. The city's
concentration  of  service  industries,  IT,  distribution,  e-commerce,  higher  education,  healthcare,  life

102sciences, and headquarters operations will support its labor market. Atlanta's educated workforce,
innovation  and  tech  hubs,  logistics  and  distribution  centers,  professional  services,  healthcare,  and
population  growth  will  drive  strong  economic  performance.    In  2025,  healthcare  will  significantly
influence the metro area's economy, although job growth in the sector will decelerate as it adjusts
from COVID-related challenges.  Expansions by Northside Hospital, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta,
and other providers will increase demand for healthcare workers.  Additionally, manufacturing will
contribute  to  Atlanta's  economic  growth  due  to  recent  development  achievements.  Conversely,
interest-sensitive  sectors  like  real  estate  development  are  not  expected  to  substantially  impact
economic growth in 2025.  By 2025, Atlanta's concentration of college-educated workers, business
partners,  cybersecurity,  high-tech  companies,  innovation  centers,  and  research  universities  will
continue  to  attract  high-tech  firms  in  life  sciences,  software  development,  R&D,  healthcare  IT,
professional  services,  logistics,  and  advanced  manufacturing.  Organizations  like  the  CDC  and
nonprofits  such  as  the  American  Cancer  Society  and  the  Arthritis  Foundation  draw  life  sciences
companies. High-tech sectors, including healthcare IT, Fintech, cybersecurity, software development,
mobile  apps,  and  corporate  innovation  centers,  have  grown  rapidly  in  Atlanta,  but  higher  interest
rates have slowed this growth. High-tech startups and expansions are sensitive to interest rates and
venture capital availability, which may improve over time but not enough to significantly boost hiring
in the near term.�

The  Selig  report  states,  �The  Atlanta  MSA  depends  on  the  distribution  and  new  construction
industries. In 2025, distribution will grow slowly compared to 2021-24. New construction prospects
differ  by  sub-sector:  government  and  manufacturing  outlooks  are  better  than  office.  The  housing
downturn from rising mortgage rates in 2022 has ended, but high mortgage rates, expensive homes,
and  a  shortage  of  construction  workers  persist.  These  issues  will  limit  immediate  growth  for
homebuilders.  However,  limited  home  listings  and  favorable  demographics  will  support  modest
growth in the homebuilding sector.�

The  Selig  report  indicates,  �That  compared  to  other  large  metro  areas,  Atlanta  relies  mainly  on
domestic markets, with exports making up just 5.9% of its GDP. Immigrants constitute 14.3% of the
population,  ranking  it  85th  among  MSAs.  Stricter  US  immigration  laws  have  negatively  impacted
Atlanta's economy, but we do not expect this to worsen in the short term. The main long-term issue
for Atlanta is its overburdened infrastructure.  Atlanta's economy benefits from its low reliance on
federal jobs, with the CDC being the largest federal employer at about 8,400 employees. Government
jobs make up only 11% of employment in Metro Atlanta, compared to 14% for the state and 15% for
the  nation.  This  means  that  public-sector  restructuring  should  have  a  smaller  impact  on  Atlanta's
economic growth than on other areas in Georgia or the U.S.�

The growth projected in next year�s proposed General Fund budget is based on the latest revenue and
macroeconomic trends, which currently indicate sustained economic growth and increasing revenues
for the City of Atlanta. The FY2026 proposed General Fund budget is based on a 9.52 tax mill rate from
a one (1) mill increase to the General Fund operating levy, offset by a 1.03 mill decrease in the debt
levy, and maintains the approved additional funding for solid waste.

The City of Atlanta Finance team reviews micro and macro-economic reports from leading economic
resources  such  as  UGA�s  Selig  Center  and  GSU  Economic  Forecasting  Center  and  utilizes  the  City
Revenue Office�s new revenue model which includes AI machine learning tools. This allows the City
Finance team to better understand the underlying economic drivers of city revenues while developing
annual  revenue  budgets.  This  process  helps  the  City  Finance  team  respond  to  changing  economic
conditions.  The  team  will  continue  to  monitor  all  city  revenues  closely  as  the  next  fiscal  year
approaches.

FY2026 Budget Anticipation:
The  Water  and  Sewer  rate  revenue  is  projected  to  be  slightly  higher  than  the  prior  fiscal  year  and
remains  relatively  stable  throughout  the  forecast  period.  This  projection  incorporates  several
conservative assumptions, including account growth, trends in customer demand, planned major events
in the upcoming fiscal year including hosting the FIFA World Cup 2026, and prevailing macroeconomic
conditions. For instance, residential water and sewer customer growth is expected to range between
1.0% and 1.5% per annum, while water and sewer consumption per customer is anticipated to decline
anywhere from 0.25% to 0.50%, in line with nation-wide trends. Commercial growth is forecasted to
range between 1.0% and 1.2% for water customers and approximately 0.4% for sewer customers. These
assumptions  have  been  developed  after  analyzing  3-year,  5-year,  and  7-year  historical  trends  in  the
City�s billing data.

The  Department  does  not  plan  to  increase  its  water  and  sewer  rates  during  the  forecast  period.
Therefore,  any  increase  in  service  revenues  will  primarily  be  attributed  to  the  combined  effects  of
customer account growth and changes in consumption per account, as outlined above.

CHARGES FOR SERVICES
This category includes operating plant charges received from the City�s inter-jurisdictional (IJ) partners, water
and  wastewater  charges  such  as  tap  fees,  water  repairs,  industrial  surcharge,  sale  of  sludge,  inspections,
administrative and subdivision plan review fees, grease permit stormwater charges, non-recurring revenue
and bad check fees, among others.

107FY2025 Budget Anticipation:
The  FY  2026  projection  of  $34.9  million  is  conservatively  higher  than  the  FY  2025  adopted  budget,
reflecting forecast assumptions about the unpredictable nature of many revenue items in this category.
This increase reflects conservative demand growth, a slight rise in flow per customer account, and City�s
investments  in  economic development,  all  of  which  are  expected  to  drive  higher  usage of  water  and
sewer utilities. The projected service revenue is expected to align with  actual levels from the current
fiscal  year,  showing  an  upward  trend  due  to  rising  operating  expenses,  which  in  turn  lead  to
reimbursable billings from other jurisdictions. Additionally, the projection incorporates the average of
the past three historical years to mitigate the impact of the irregular nature of many revenue items in
this category.

INTERGOVERNMENTAL REVENUES
The Municipal Option Sales Tax (MOST) is a  referendum  to  impose  a  special  one- percent  sales  tax
to  partially  fund  the  City�s  water  and  sewer  projects  and  associated  costs.  Established  under
authorizing  state  legislation,  MOST  was  initially  placed in  effect  for  a  16-year  term,  subject  to  voter
renewal every four years, beginning on October 1, 2004.  City  of  Atlanta  voters  elected  t o   renew  the
MOST  for  an  additional  four- year  term  in March 2008, March 2012, March 2016, and March 2020.  In
May  2024,  75%  of  voters  reauthorized  MOST  for  another  four-year  period,  extending  the  sales  tax
through October 2028.

Revenues

FY2026 Budget Anticipation:
The  FY  2026  anticipated  revenues  from  the  Municipal  Option  Sales  Tax  (MOST)  are  conservatively
estimated at $220.0 million, maintaining the same projection as the prior FY 2025 budget. While MOST
receipts have significantly increased in recent years, from $155 million in FY 2021 to approximately $209
million  in  FY  2024,  revenue  growth  may  not  continue  at  the  same  pace  due  to  current  economic
uncertainties.  As  a  result,  a  conservative  approach  has  been  taken  in  forecasting  revenue  growth.
However, there is a long-term optimistic outlook for this revenue stream, driven by projections of steady,
albeit modest, customer growth and improving regional economic conditions.

INVESTMENT INCOME
This category is for interest earned as a result of the Department's Fund equity in the Cash Pool. The
Department does earn interest on its Fund 5051 cash portion in the Investment Cash Pool and as a result

108FY2025 Budget Anticipation:
Historically, interest earnings have fluctuated based on varying cash balances in this fund. However,
they have increased significantly in recent years due to higher savings rates and a growing balance of
encumbered funds for capital projects. Interest revenue saw a substantial increase in FY 2024 as a result
of higher savings rates. In FY 2025, the department completed a bond defeasance transaction using a
portion of the cash pool allocation, leading to a reduced growth forecast for this revenue category in FY
2026.

OTHER FINANCING SOURCES
This category includes the administrative fee charged to Fulton County for collecting the County�s sewer
payments. Per Article IX Section 9.0 of the agreement, the County agrees to pay the City a monthly fee
calculated at 8% of the total County monthly collections.

Revenue Fund

The Department of Watershed Management has implemented a department-wide reorganization, which
has streamlined operations and aligned similar functions with an overall goal of reducing operational
and maintenance expenses.  DWM has also introduced a state-of-the-art Command Center, serving as a
central hub for monitoring, managing, and coordinating real-time operations within the  department.
The center ensures swift responses to service disruptions, oversees system performance, and supports
efficient  decision-making  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the  city�s  water  distribution  and  wastewater
systems. By integrating data analytics, technology, and communication channels, the Command Center
enhances  operational  transparency,  optimizes  resource  deployment,  and  allows  for  the  prompt  and
effective  resolution  of  water  infrastructure  challenges.  Ultimately,  this  approach  reduces  waste,
generates cost savings, and improves overall departmental efficiency.

level of customer service and efficiency while exercising fiscal and environmental responsibility.  The
Department classifies its revenues into two general categories: Aeronautical and Non-Aeronautical.
Aeronautical

LANDING FEES

The Department of Aviation collects landing fees from signatory and non-signatory carriers.  These
fees are intended to recover the cost of operating and maintaining the airfield; including all capital
improvement projects, debt service requirement and coverage.

and 8,700 parking spaces. Each of the rental car companies pay the Department of Aviation 10% of
annual  gross  sales  in  return  for  occupying  RCC  space.  The  rental  car  companies  are  subject  to  a
Minimum Annual Guarantee (MAG), and they reimburse the Airport for utilities

FY2026 Budget Anticipation:
The  City�s  E-911  revenue  anticipation  correlates  to  per  capita  and  telecommunication  subscriber
trends.  In the past, this fund had operated in a deficit position annually due to insufficient  landline
and  wireless  fees  to  cover  operating  expenses.  In May of 2017, the City approved an increase to
the Public Safety Access Assessment from $26 for residential to $34 and from $307 for commercial
to  $397  to  cover  increases  in  operating  expenses.  In  May  of  2018,  the  Georgia  General  Assembly
passed HB 751 which increased the pre-paid wireless charge from $0.75 to $1.50 and transferred
responsibility  of  distributing  this  revenue  to  the  State  of  GA.  The  FY2026  proposed  budget

FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation:
This  revenue  is  tied  to  activity  within  the  lodging  and  hospitality  related  sectors.  The  proposed
budget reflects the expectation of growth in this revenue from the FIFA Club and World Cup matches.

The  Selig  report  highlights  that,  �Atlanta�s  hospitality  industry  has  struggled  to  recover  from  the
pandemic due to its focus on business rather than leisure travel. Before the pandemic, Atlanta was
the sixth most-visited U.S. city, mainly because of its large meetings and convention sector. The metro
area ranks seventh in the U.S. for hotel room inventory. Heavy reliance on business travel hindered
economic  recovery,  but  virtual  travel  is  now  a  standard  practice.  The  business  travel  industry  is
expected to contribute more to Atlanta's economy in 2025 than in 2024.�

The  Federal  Reserve  Bank  Beige  book  dated  January  2025  states,  �Travel  and  tourism  activity
increased  at  a  moderate  pace  in  recent  weeks.  Many  industry  contacts  reported  stronger  holiday
travel than last year. Some hotels noted room  rates were down slightly, but many reported strong
bookings  and  increased  revenue.  Cruising  activity,  as  well  as  business  and  group  travel,  remained
strong."

CBRE Q4 report states �Looking towards 2025, Atlanta RevPAR is expected to grow 2.7%.  Occupancy
is forecast to remain at 66.8%, while average room rates are projected to increase 2.7%. Revenue is
expected to continue to climb in 2025.�

RENTAL/MOTOR VEHICLE TAX FUND
The Rental/Motor Vehicle Fund contains revenue from transactions associated with a 3.0% excise
tax  levied  on  Car  Rental  Facilities  within  the  City  corporate  limits.  This  Fund  operates  as  a  pass-
through fund with all the revenues remitted to a Bank Trustee for debt service payments pursuant
to the trust indenture.

budget anticipation reflects a decline in motor vehicle rentals due to expected shortages in rental car
inventories.

SOLID WASTE SERVICES REVENUE FUND
The  Solid  Waste  Services  Revenue  Fund  supports  the  operation  of  sanitary  services  activities,
including  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste,  recycling,  yard  waste  and  bulk  rubbish,  street
sweeping,  de-littering,  debris  removal,  right-of-way-cutting,  dead  animal  removal,  education,  and
enforcement.  It  also  includes  land  post-closure  management  and  city-wide  emergency  response
operations.  Revenue is generated from user fees or charges for these services.

FY2026 Proposed Budget Anticipation:
Solid Waste Fund revenues are primarily comprised of user fees to cover the cost of operations.  A
partial fee increase was approved in FY2021, and a full increase was implemented in FY2022.  For
FY2023, approved funding for solid waste was included in the general operations mill rate in the
form of a 0.67 ad valorem tax levy increase to the General fund.   This resulted in an FY2023 approved
solid waste service fee rate reduction and corresponding decrease to revenues within the Solid Waste
Services  revenue  fund.  In  FY2025,  a  3.5%  rate  increase  was  approved,  along  with  additional
increases of 2% in FY2026 and FY2027.  The FY2026 proposed budget anticipation revenue amount
reflects  this  increase  to  the  solid  waste  service  fees  and  maintains  the  corresponding  tax  levy
increase in the general fund.

Summary of Operations

The City of Atlanta�s (City) Department of Aviation
is responsible for operating the Airport.

Hartsfield-Jackson  Atlanta  International  Airport
(ATL/Airport)  is  the  �World�s  Busiest  and  Most
Efficient Airport�.  In the calendar year 2024, ATL
handled  over  108  million  passengers,  along  with
more than a quarter million aircraft operations.  It
is the principal airport servicing both Georgia and
the  Southeastern  United  States.  The  Airport
occupies  a  4,750-acre  site  in  Clayton  and  Fulton
counties,  approximately
ten  miles  south  of
downtown  Atlanta.    It  also  serves  as  a  primary
transfer  point  in  the  national  air  transportation
system.    Celebrating  its  centennial  anniversary  in
2025, as headquarters to hometown carrier Delta
Air  Lines,  ATL  serves  as  a  global  gateway  for  air
travel, offering nonstop service to more than 150
domestic and 70 international destinations.

Our last economic impact study boasts an indirect
and  direct  economic  impact  of  $66  billion  for  the
Southeast  region.  The  Airport  is  also  responsible
for  nearly  400,000  jobs,  with  63,000  employees
working  directly  on  airport  property.    As  the
largest employer for the state of Georgia, ATL is the
chief economic engine of metro Atlanta and one of
the  single  largest  economic  generators  in  the
Southeastern United States.

ATL operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year,
employing  nearly  a  thousand  full-time  City  of
Atlanta  employees,  approximately  nearly  300
firefighters, and more than 100 police officers.

FY2025 Accomplishments

As business and leisure travel increases, Hartsfield-
Jackson Atlanta International Airport  remains the
world�s busiest and most efficient airport. ATL also
continues  to  be  recognized  as  the  leader  in
concessions,
sustainability,
operations,
architectural engineering, and construction.
In  FY2025,  Hartsfield-Jackson
received
following honors:

the

�  Airport  Council  International  world�s  busiest
airport  for  calendar  year  2024-ATL�s  27th
consecutive  year  being  recognized  with  this
distinction.

�  The  Airside  Operations  Office  at  Hartsfield-
Jackson, a nearly 9,000-square-foot renovation
located  on  the  apron  level  of  Concourse  T,
achieved LEED v4 Gold Certification under the
LEED
Interior  Design  and  Construction:
Commercial  Interiors  rating  system.  The
facility  is  projected  to  save  an  impressive
35.23%  in  water  usage  and  20.9%  in  energy
consumption.

�  Hartsfield-Jackson  won  Airport  Council
International�s  2024  Airport  Service  Quality
(ASQ)
40-million

the project will be completed at the end of FY
2026.

�  The  first  phase  of  the  Terminal  North  Master
Plan will be completed in FY2025.  The goal of
the project is to expand the ticket lobby.  Part
of the goal is to relocate numerous offices and
support functions out of the lobby to facilitate
this.    Due  to  the  complexity  of  the  overall
project, the work will be completed in 2029.

�  The new Ground Transportation Center (GTC)
will open at the beginning of FY2026.  The new
GTC will provide additional capacity for taxis,
local  and  regional  shuttles,  and  other  ground
transportation providers.

�

In  the  second  quarter  of  FY2026,  we  will
reconstruct Runway 9L-27R.  As with previous
runway  reconstructions,  the  work  will  occur
24 hours per day.  We have scheduled the $150
million  reconstruction  project  to  occur  in  60
days.

�  We will start phase 2 of our six-phase restroom
upgrade  project  during  the  first  quarter  of
FY2026.  The second phase will reconstruct six
restrooms while also expanding select ones.

�  DOA continues to work on the airport master
plan  update.    We  expect  the  update  to  be
completed in December 2025.

�  At

the  end  of  CY2025,  we  will  start
construction  on  replacing  preconditioned  air
components  at  just  over  100  gates.    This
approximately $110 million project will occur
over a three-year period.

FY2026 Projects

FY2026 Adopted Budget

The  airport�s  capital
improvement  program,
ATLNext, completed approximately $1.27 billion of
work  in  CY2024.    FY2026  is  programmed  to  see
over $1.3 billion of work completed.  The following
major projects will be ongoing:

�  The  program�s  most  significant  project,
Concourse  D  Widening,  continues  to  make
major  headway.    We  continue  to  track  a  late
2028 or early 2029 completion.

�  All  levels  of  South  Deck  Phase  1  will  be
completely poured by the end of CY 2025 and

The  FY2026  Operating  budget  will  see  growing
expenses due to major contract increases driven by
both  inflation,  and  expanded  scope,  including
contracts  for  the  Terminal  operation,  Parking
Operation  People  Movers,  Technology,  and  Asset
Management.  These increases were partially offset
increased  revenue  through  Parking  rate
by
increases and airline rate increases.

provides  temporary
income  for  former  City  workers.  Workers  do  not
pay any costs.  Eligibility for benefits is determined

funds  that  are  remaining  after  all  revenues  and
expenditures are projected for budgeting purposes

From  CY2023  to  CY2024,  we  have  seen  the
following decline in Violent Crimes:

Aggravated Assault decreased by 34%
Shootings Decreased by 25%
Robbery Decreased by 33%
Homicide Decreased by 31%
APD  Homicide  Case  Clearance  Rate  is  77%
(Above the National Average: 57.8%)
In  2024,  3,823  firearms  were  recovered,  and
2,395 physical arrests were conducted.
Over  the  past  two  years,  APD's  workforce�
comprising of both sworn officers and civilian
staff�grew by 6%, reflecting a strategic effort
to  strengthen  the  department's  capacity  and
improve operational effectiveness.
588  Police  Officers  have  been  hired  since
2022.
In  2024,  11,000
job  applications  were
received, an increase of 60% from the previous
year.
 This  was  driven  by  key  initiatives
focused  on  enhancing  recruitment  efforts.
These include leveraging technology, forming

transitioning

strategic  partnerships,  optimizing  processes,
and  adjusting  salaries  to  attract  a  larger  and
more qualified pool of candidates.
APD  continued  efforts  to  improve  employee
experience,  retention,  and  morale  have
yielded  results,  with  attrition  decreasing  by
19% from 2023 to 2024.
Launched  in  2024,  the  Childcare  Incentive
Program (CHIP) provides additional financial
assistance  for  daycare  to  eligible  sworn
officers,  helping  to  improve  their  work-life
balance. 31  Officers  have  received  a  total  of
$139,200 in childcare assistance, as of October
31, 2024.
199 Leaders graduated from the Atlanta Police
Leadership Institute (APLI) between 2022 and

leaving or struggling in the academy. Since its
inception, 15 recruits have participated, with
11  successfully
to  civilian
positions,  demonstrating

would likely have gone uncollected.
Prosecution support services: Legal support for

pre

FY2025 Accomplishments

�
Community Prosecution

Increased  activity  of  the  Office  of  the  City
community  prosecution  and
Solicitor

in

and

and

amplifying

communities

outreach.  This  is  a  preventative  resource,
tasking  prosecutors�  offices  with  generating,
cultivating,
community
involvement  to  identify  problems,  address
issues and concerns and develop solutions in a
manner  that  best  serves  the  community.
Although  we  have  always  maintained  a
partnership  with  law  enforcement,  other  city
departments
using
prevention,  interventions,  and  enforcement
methods  to  hold  offenders  accountable,  we
have  become  more  community-involved  with
an  emphasis  on  using  problem-solving
techniques to address the unique crimes in the
various communities. We have partnered with
colleges and universities within the city limits,
and several other partners to accomplish this
goal  by  way  of  traffic  safety  seminars,
backpack giveaways, Policing Alternatives and
Diversion  (PAD),  AVA  Inc.,  (Atlanta  Victim
Assistance),  and  Young  Litigators  of  the  Life
School and other Atlanta Public Schools (APS).
The  Office  of  the  City  Solicitor  continued  to
aggressively  file  nuisance  actions  against
problem properties.  We will continue to utilize
the ability to file injunctions in Fulton County
Superior Court based on the excessive number
of police service calls and repeated number of
code  enforcement  violations.  The  Office  will
seek  injunctive  relief  and  restrain  businesses
from operating when the owner is unwilling to
into  compliance.  The
bring  the  property
includes  over  200
initiative
nuisance
properties. Additionally, the office is active in
collaboration  with  other  city  departments  to
reduce  blight  and  to  provide  training  for
participants  in  the  City�s  Code  Enforcement
Academy.
The Office of the City Solicitor will continue its
collaboration  with
the  Department  of
Watershed Management and has expanded to
include  the  Department  of  Public  Works  to
prosecute cases related to illegal dumping.
The  Office  of  the  City  Solicitor  remains
committed  to  enhancing  training  for  the
Atlanta Police Department�s Training Academy
and other law enforcement agencies, focusing
on  both  recruiting  and  in-service  training  for
comprehensive support.
The  Office  of  the  City  Solicitor  maintains  its
partnership  with  the  Atlanta  Public  School
System�s  Police  Department  (APSPD)
to
address  truancy  and  other  youth-related
issues.  We  support  the  Young  Litigator's

cases and will continue to explore efficiencies
in service delivery. It remains the mechanism
for resolving misdemeanor cases that originate
in the City of Atlanta Municipal Court and are
later bound over to Fulton County State Court.

FY2026 Proposed Program Highlights

�

�

�

The Office of the City Solicitor will support the
Mayor�s  Year  of  the  Youth  Initiative  by
providing employment opportunities through
the City Department of Labor�s Initiatives and
the  establishment  of  a  Junior  Prosecutor
Program for young people to learn the various
aspects of our justice system with emphasis on
careers in the judicial system.
The  Office  of  the  City  Solicitor  continues  to
aggressively file nuisance actions on behalf of
the  Safe  and  Secure  Housing  Initiative.  This
initiative
focused  upon  multi-family
dwellings  and  that  are  suffering  neglect  from
unresponsive landlords

Project and are developing programs to engage
youth  creatively.  One  initiative  is  the  Teens
Learning Control program, which offers drivers
under  21  an  opportunity  to  have  their  cases
dismissed  or  fines  reduced  by  completing
modules  on  defensive  driving  and  making
responsible choices.

�
Diversion and Alternative Prosecution Programs

�

�

�

�

�

�

The  diversion  programs,  (PTIT,  CPTIT,  and
PTIBL)  were  modified  to  include  ordinance
violations  along  with  criminal  and  traffic
offenses.  Initiatives  were  established  to  enable
us to easily identify eligible defendants.  Our goal
has been to make citizens aware of alternatives
to  resolving  cases  in  lieu  of  prosecution.  These
programs are highly effective in resolving cases
and reducing the footprint in the court.
Operation  Double  Victory:  This  collaboration
between  the  Fulton  County  Solicitor  General
Office  and  the  City  of  Atlanta  Solicitor�s  Office
aims to improve efficiency for the benefit of all
citizens.  On  February  15,  2024,  both  agencies
participated  in  a  cross-swearing-in  ceremony
held  at  Atlanta  Municipal  Court.  The  joint
operation  has  successfully  reduced  backlog
crime at various properties throughout the city
to ensure a safe environment for all citizens.
The  office  also  continues  to  ensure  a  safer  city
for  all  by  investigating  and  reviewing  calls  for
service  for  both  residential  and  commercial
properties  and  filing  legal  pleadings  when
deemed necessary.
The  office  continues  to  provide  DUI/High-
Intensity  Traffic  enforcement
to
educate and refresh law enforcement officers in
the  observation  and  apprehension  of  serious
traffic offenders.
Police Academy Training: The office continues to
support and train in �Courtroom Demeanor and
Testimony�  at  the  Atlanta  Police  Academy  for
new recruits and seasoned officers. The training
reinforces the importance of effective ticket and
report  writing  and  what  to  expect  at  trial  on
traffic and non-traffic misdemeanors as well as
ordinances.
While  the appellate  process/practice  continues
to  be  successful  with  90+  %  of  decisions
affirmed,  we  remain  in  a  state  of  STAY,  as  the
Court  of  Appeals  decides  the  breadth  of
prosecutorial  authority  in  Atlanta  Municipal
Court.

Mission Statement

The  City  Auditor�s  Office  promotes  honesty,
efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in City
government.
Core Functions

�

�

�

Conducting  performance  audits  to  support
legislative oversight and public accountability.
Making recommendations to management that
will  foster  improvements  in  effectiveness  of

Summary of Operations

The  office  provides  objective  information  and
useful recommendations through audit reports and
continuous  audit  procedures.  Under  direction  of
the  City�s  Audit  Committee,  the  City  Auditor
conducts  audits  to  assess  whether  City  activities
and  programs  comply  with  applicable  laws  and
intended  outcomes  and
regulations,  achieve
benefits,  use
and
economically
efficiently,  and  operate  with  adequate  systems  of
internal control.

resources

Audit topics are selected through risk assessment,
City  Council  requests,  and  management  requests.
Topics  may  also  include  analyses  of  concerns
targeted by proposed legislation and policies. Audit
recommendations  address  safeguarding  assets,
streamlining  processes,  managing
revenue,
managing  contracts,  monitoring  and  reporting
functions,  and  complying  with
internal  and
external policies and regulations.

Auditors  work  with  management  of  the  audited
area  to  discuss  and  refine  the  scope  of  an  audit.
Audit  teams  conduct  fieldwork,  which  generally
involves  interviews,  identifying  best  practices,
document review, site visits, and data analysis. The
teams discuss preliminary findings with

a  public

management  to  confirm  understanding  and  to
develop workable recommendations. Audits result
and
report  with
in
recommendations.  Management�s  response
is
included  in  the  report,  and  auditors  follow  up  on
the  implementation  status  of  recommendations
after report release.
Continuous  auditing

findings

  leverages  technology  to  test
controls  and  to  identify  potential  red  flags  in
transactions as, or soon after, they occur. For  our
continuous audit program, we have three goals: to
clean up permissions in Oracle ATLCloud; to detect
and  review  red  flags  promptly;  and  to  provide
input to audit planning, both for the annual audit
plan and individual audit engagements. To this end,
we

support

and

 allows us to effectively prepare an
audit plan. We need to identify which activities are
the  most  important  and  detect  areas  that  pose
potential  risk  to  the  city.  To  provide  the  most
benefit,  our  audits  need  to  be  targeted  and
relevant.  We  conduct  risk  assessments  both  to
compare  departments  and  offices  based  on  their
potential risk and to better serve the city with our
audits.
The Audit Committee

 comprises audit, finance, and
management  professionals  appointed  by  the  City
Council, the Council President, and the Mayor. The
Committee  appoints  and  supervises  the  City
Auditor,  approves  the  annual  audit  plan  and
completed audit reports, oversees the City�s annual
financial  audit,  and  undertakes  other activities  as
resources allow and as consistent with its authority
under  the  City  Charter.  This  structure  ensures
organizational independence because the office is
organizationally outside the reporting line of those
responsible
for  areas  subject  to  audit.  The
Committee  holds  public  meetings  every  other
month to conduct its business.

The  City  Auditor�s  Office  added  a  new  quick
response  audit  team  in  FY2025.  A  �quick
response  audit�  is  a  single-issue  audit  with  a
narrow  focus  that  is  designed  to  address  a
limited  objective  relatively  quickly.  We
completed  our  first  quick  response  audit  and
trained  all  staff  in  quick  response  audit
methodologies.

We  finalized  a  method  to  prioritize  audit
recommendations to assist in oversight. A high
priority  audit  recommendations  has  one  or
more of the following characteristics:

mismanagement

Citywide impact
Addresses
of
operations  and/or  budgets  across
departments
Addresses  a  threat  to  public  safety
and/or public health
Addresses evidence of fraud, waste, or
abuse

o

o

Addresses
noncompliance  with
legal/regulatory  requirements  that
could result in large fines or lowered
bond ratings
The condition or risk is important and
urgent.

As of March 7, 2025:
16% of 240 open audit recommendations were
rated as high priority.
30% of 240 open audit recommendations were
rated as medium priority.
54% of 240 open audit recommendations were
rated as low priority.

�

�

We  continued  to  work  with  departments  to
follow-up  on
the  status  of  open  audit
recommendations, as required by city charter.
Business owners report through Missionmark
whether  a  recommendation  is  not  started,
started, partly implemented, or implemented;
provide  a  description  of  corrective  actions
taken; and upload supporting documentation.
Audit staff email departments reminders about
due dates and verify that the corrective actions
and  documentation  support  the  suggested
status  and  accept  the  status  or  request  more
information.  Missionmark  includes  a  publicly
available  interactive  dashboard  to  report  the
status  of  audit  recommendations.  Midway
through the third  quarter  of fiscal year 2025,
we  closed  approximately  one-fifth  of  the
recommendations open at the beginning of the
year  with  44%  of  those  recommendations
implemented. Some recommendations that are
in  progress
to
strengthening business license enforcement�
are already having a positive effect.

those  related

such  as

�

�  Continuous Audit

We  continued  to  work  with  procurement,
to  monitor
accounts  payable,  and  AIM
sensitive  access  and  segregation  of  duties
conflicts that arise monthly. We performed our
first annual review in these areas of previously
accepted  risks  and  mitigating  controls.  We
worked  with  human  resources  to  test  and
clean  data  and  remediate  unneeded  access.
We  also
individuals  who  are  both
employees of the city and registered suppliers
to  the  city  and  refer  recommendations  to  the
Department of Procurement, the Ethics Office,
and/or the Office of the Inspector General, as
appropriate.  We  have  provided  independent
the  Department  of
analysis

to  assist

flag

Procurement in its efforts to clean the supplier
table.

�  Risk Assessment

quality  management  is  suitably  designed  and
operating effectively.

We also plan to engage a firm to conduct actuarial
audits  of  the  city�s  three  defined  benefit  pension
funds.  The  last  actuarial  audit,  released  January
2020,  identified  concerns  about  the  data  the  city
provided  to  the  actuary  and  inconsistencies  in
assumptions  among  the  three  funds.  The  city  has
since  undergone  significant  efforts  to  clean  the
data, with the result that the financial audit for the
year  ending  June  30,  2024,  had  no  material
weaknesses  or  significant  deficiencies  related  to
the pension funds.

Finally,  in  FY2026,  we  will  devote  effort  to
succession  planning.  Many  of  our  organizational
changes in the past few years have been intended
to  develop  staff  and  prepare  them  for  future
leadership roles.

We implemented a new risk assessment model
with  goals  of  gathering  more  input  from  the
administration
incorporating  more
forward-looking  than  lagging  indicators.  We
plan
risk
to  pilot  a  department-level
assessment to gather more management input
and identify risk-based audit opportunities.

and

�  Audit Quality

The  City  Charter  requires  that  we  follow
Government Auditing Standards to ensure the
quality  of  our  work  and  to  ensure  that  we
conduct  our  work  and
results
objectively. After implementing new software
and  reorganizing  the  office  in  the  past  three
years, we�ve worked to ensure that our written
procedures align with the changes, developed
monitoring  tools,  and  trained  staff  on  the
procedures and use of the tools.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC DEFENDER

Mission Statement

The mission of the Office of the Public Defender is to
provide a zealous and holistic legal defense to people
charged with offenses before the Atlanta Municipal
includes  effective
Court.  Legal  representation
defense  strategies,  and  holistic  attention
to
restorative measures that can reduce contacts with
the criminal legal system and improve the quality of
life for the client.
Vision Statement

The  office  also  partners  with  public  and  private
sector  service  providers,  and  various  training
agencies  and  outreach  centers,  investing  in  the
future  of  Atlanta�s  youth  and  adults,  working  to
restore stability to their lives.

FY2025  Accomplishments

�  Holistic Employment Program (H.E.P.)

Central to the mission of the department is the core
belief in the constitutional guarantees of due process
and  equal  protection  under  the  law.  Defending  the
client in court is paramount. Central to the vision is
that  traditional  perceptions  of  public  defense  are
redefined  by  the  client-centered  holistic  practice
model.  Basic needs of the accused offender become
part  of  the  case,  and  outcomes  include  linkage  to
housing,  health  care,  education,  and  employment.
Consequently,  the  client�s  involvement  with  the
criminal legal system is minimized, the quality of life
for  the  client  and  the  community  where  the  client
lives improves, and public safety in the community is
elevated.
Summary of Operations

through

The Office of the Public Defender provides criminal
defense  services  to  indigent  defendants  who  are
accused  of  violating  Atlanta  city  ordinances,  and
misdemeanor traffic laws. Public Defenders provide
counsel  at  all  phases  of  litigation,  from  point  of
arrest,
include  appellate
trial,  and
representation  in  the  higher  courts  of  Georgia.  The
justice,
office  is  also  dedicated  to  therapeutic
addressing underlying reasons for unlawful conduct
such  as  mental  illness  and  substance  dependency.
Attorneys, client advocates, and social workers in the
department  seek  treatment  services  for  clients  in
need.  Clients  are  linked  to  mental  health  facilities,
drug  rehabilitation  centers,  state,  and
federal
assistance  with  basic  needs  such  as  housing,  food,
education, and employment.

The  Office  of  the  Public  Defender  has
continued
its  partnership  with  private
employers and non- profit job readiness and
career  development  training  agencies  to
support clients seeking employment. Service
support  includes  license  and  identification
restoration, housing sustainability measures,
and financial literacy through an established
curriculum,  that  can  remove  barriers  to
employment.

FY2026 Proposed Program Highlights

The primary objective for FY2026 is to enhance the
Office�s  efficiency  and  effectiveness  by  prioritizing
investigative caseload management, optimizing the
intake  process,  and  expanding  training  initiatives
citywide.  These  efforts  will  be
informed  by
investigative  findings  and  identified  deficiencies
within  City  processes.  Additionally,  the  Office  will
strengthen internal communication and foster more
effective collaboration with all City departments.

A  key  priority  will  be  reaffirming  the  Office  of
Inspector  General�s  (OIG)  independence�ensuring
that  complaint  reviews  and  findings  remain  free
from  external  influence.  However,  independence
does  not  equate  to  isolation.  Open  communication
and  cooperation  with  City  departments  are
essential,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  training  and
policy  implementation,  which  are  critical  to  the
Office�s overall success.

The  quality  of  life  for  City  of  Atlanta  residents
depends  on  the  reliability  of  transportation,  the
dependability  of  water,  wastewater,  and  storm
water  systems,  the  ability  to  safely  dispose  of
waste,  the  accessibility  to  culture  and  recreation,
and  many  other  essential  public  services.  Quality
service
can  be  achieved  by  proper
enhancement,  replacement,  and  maintenance  of
capital
a  Capital
assets  by
Improvement Program (CIP).

implementing

levels

To  qualify  as  a  Capital  Improvement  Project,  the
item  in  question  must  meet  one  of  the  following
criteria:

�
�
�

�

�

Real property acquisition (Land)
Construction of new facilities
Addition  (a  modification  that  changes  the
structural  �footprint�  of  the  facility)  to  existing
facilities greater than or equal to $25,000
Remodeling/repair/preservation        of
interior/exterior of any facility greater  than
or equal to $25,000
Demolition  of  existing  facilities  greater  than
or equal to $25,000

  the

� Major  equipment  items  or  projects  including

or

than

equal

to
(excludes   vehicles   unless   >=

computer infrastructure, which are
greater
$25,000
$50,000)
Infrastructure        projects  (a        road,  bridge,
intersection,  drainage  system,  or  sewer
structure, etc.)
Planning and inventory studies more than
$25,000

�

�

Project  costs  include  all  phases  of  a  project,
including planning, design, utility relocation, right of
way      acquisition, etc.   All  phases  of the project are
budgeted  in  a  Capital  Projects  Fund.    The  City  of
Atlanta develops its capital projects budget, a plan of
proposed capital expenditures (CapEX), based on its
Capital Improvements Program process.    Requests
for  capital  projects  from  City  departments  should
include  the  estimated  impact  that  these  projects
will  have,  if  any,  on  current  and  future  operating
budgets.

The  initial  acquisition  cost  of  the  project  plus  any
operating  expenditures  to  be  incurred  over  the
lifetime  of  the  facility  or  equipment  are  reviewed
and taken into consideration  during the process of
budget  recommendations,  budget  proposal,  and
final  budget  approval  by  the  City  Council.  Capital
projects that are intended for repairs and/or minor
improvements  of  existing  facilities  or  equipment
usually      do     not       carry      significant operating
impacts.

Major  capital  projects  that  are  intended  for  the
construction  of  new  facilities,  major  renovation
projects, or the acquisition of expensive equipment,
may require additional maintenance and operating
expenses,  the  hiring  of  new  personnel,  or  the
issuance  and  repayment  of  debt.  The  impact  on
operations (net of measurable savings) of approved
projects  is  included  by  city  departments  in  their
operating  budget  requests  and  the  FY2026
Proposed operating budget.

A  capital  project  may  be  divided  into  various  cost
centers  for  accounting  purposes.      Each  center
represents the budgeting of funds for a project by an
organizational unit within a fund.  The capital budget
status  report  provides  the  fund  summary  and
detailed anticipations and appropriations.     A list of
all  projects  ( detailed  appropriations)  has  been
included as well.

The FY2026 to FY2030 budget provides the status of
active capital projects that are new or will continue
from  the  previous  fiscal  year.    It  is  based  on  the
FY2025  projected,  roll-forward  balance  plus  any
additional funding from  new bonds or interest. For
FY2026, the capital projects projected expenditure
amount totals $9.3B, and the funding by source is
depicted on the next page.

A  few of the  items  listed  in the  Capital section  will
have  an  operating  impact.  These  items  include
public  safety  vehicles  and  equipment  that  are
budgeted    as    an    operating    transfer    from    the
General Fund to the Capital Finance Fund.

Infrastructure Program

in  the  city�s

Atlanta voters approved three ballot measures on
that  will  make  significant

investments
infrastructure  and
economy.  The  measures  �  two  bonds  and  the
renewal  of  a  special  sales  tax  �  will  put  $750M
toward  vital  transportation,  recreation,  public
safety, and arts projects across the city.

The  City  of  Atlanta  has
identified  major
infrastructure  needs  across  streets,  sidewalks,
parks,  recreation  centers  and  public  safety
facilities.  To  make  progress  against  these  needs,
the  City  of  Atlanta  has  prepared  a  $750M
infrastructure program for the next five years.

The  first  two  measures  are  infrastructure  bonds
totaling  $400M.  A  $210M  bond  will  address
vertical infrastructure such as police facilities, fire
stations,  recreation  centers  and  other  parks  and
recreation  facilities.  A  second  $190M  bond  will
including
address  horizontal
transportation  and  parks.  These  two  bonds  are
general  obligation  (GO)  bonds  which  have  long
been  a  primary  source  of  funding  for  capital

and

The  third  measure  is  a  renewal  of  the  TSPLOST
(Transportation  Special  Purpose  Local  Option
Sales Tax) program which will generate $350M for
transportation  projects.  Atlanta�s  TSPLOST  is  a
4/10  of  a  penny  sales  tax,  applying  to  most
purchases made within the city. By law, a TSPLOST
can only be used for certain transportation capital
projects.  Atlanta  voters  approved
first
TSPLOST program in 2016, which expired in 2022.

the

Of  the  $750M  program,  the  largest  category  for
investment  is  transportation  infrastructure  with
$460.2M.  The  second  largest  category  is  parks,
recreation,  and  the  arts  with  $161.4M.  The  third
category is public safety with $92.3M. And the final
category  is  $36M  for  district  local  funds.  Each
district�s  councilmember  will  be  able  to  allocate
$3M to neighborhood projects that are not already

covered by the larger citywide investments in the
package.

BOND FUNDS

Annual  Bond  funds  and  the  1987-2004  Bond
Project  Funds  provide  for  disbursement  of  the
proceeds of an annual $8 million General Obligation
Bond  issue,  which  is  divided  into  $4  million  for
general  city  purposes  and  $4  million  for  school
purposes.   The City has been authorized since 1968
to  annually  issue  general  obligation  bonds  of  $8
million  without  referendum.    These  bonds  are
backed  by  the  "full  faith  and  credit"  of  the  City's
property  tax  base.    Historically,  the  City  has  used
these  funds  to  support  an  array  of  programs
including  economic  development,  transportation,
public  safety  and  judicial  systems, recreational and
cultural opportunities and environmental protection
  The  last  bond  issue  was

dedicated  primarily  to
land  acquisition,  signal
modernization,  installation  of  freeway  lighting  and
bridge  improvements.   Prior to  1987,  each  general
obligation  issue  was  accounted  for  in  the  Annual
Bond  Fund.  Beginning  in  1987,  each  annual  bond
issue has been accounted for separately through the
establishment of a specific project fund. Other Bond
Funds are the Park Improvement Fund, the General
Government Capital Outlay Fund, the 1993
School  Improvement  Bond  Fund,  Aviation  Bond
Funds,  and  Water  and  Wastewater  Bond  Funds.
These funds account for proceeds used in obtaining,
renovating, and constructing major fixed assets.

interest  payments  due

The  Bond  Sinking  Funds  are  legally  required
accounting  entities  to  ensure  the  allocation  of
principal  and
for  the
protection of the bond holders.   The money for these
funds is raised through a special City Bond Tax levy
against  real  and  personal  property.    The  millage
associated  with  this  levy  is  determined  as  the rate
which  will  allow  the  City  to  make  principal  and
interest payments for the upcoming fiscal year.  The
funds raised through this tax levy are to be used only
for  the  retirement  of  City  and  Board  of  Education
outstanding  bond  issues.  There  is  provision  for
appropriation to  sinking  funds  to allow  the  City  to
make principal and interest payments to the paying
agent on a timely basis as

the  amounts  become  due.   The  interest  payments
are  due  semi-annually,  requiring  payment  by  the
City  before  the  receipt  from  Fulton  County  of  the
tax revenues.  Therefore, it is necessary to maintain
reserves that allow the City to make these interest
payments when they are due.

The City of Atlanta faced an infrastructure backlog
of  more  than  $900  million.  To  address  the  City's
most  pressing  infrastructure  challenges  such  as
improving our City's roads, bridges, sidewalks and
upgrade critical  public  buildings and  facilities, the
citizens of Atlanta approved an infrastructure bond
referendum
these  repairs  and
for
improvements.  The  referendum passed  with  88%
approval from Atlanta�s voters in a special election
on March 17, 2015.

A  Tax  Allocation  District  (TAD)  is  established  for
the  purpose  of  catalyzing  investment  by  financing
certain redevelopment activities in underdeveloped
or
dollars.
Redevelopment  costs  are  financed  through  the
pledge  of  future  incremental  increases  in  property
taxes  generated by  the  resulting new development.
Typically,  upon  creation,  TADs  have  vacant
commercial  and  residential  properties,  blighted
conditions and numerous vacant buildings  or  are  in

In  order  for  an  area  to  be  designated  a  TAD,  the
government must  verify that  the  area  is  in  need  of
redevelopment.  However, the area is not required to
be  blighted, which is  a  requirement in  many states.
These  findings  are  reported  in  a  Redevelopment
Plan, which demonstrates why the area  needs  to  be

  The  Plan  provides

The  Atlanta  Beltline  Tax  Allocation  District  was
established  to  assure  that  the  City  of  Atlanta
maintains its historical position as  the commercial
center of the region and provides an alternative to
the  continued  sprawling  patterns  of  development
in  the  region.      The  City  recognizes  that  new
streetscapes,  sidewalks,  parks,  street-level  retail,
alternative
facilities,  and  new
housing  are  needed  to  create  an  attractive  and
prosperous  community.      The  Beltline  TAD  will
provide  incentives  and  initial  funding  to  catalyze
the rehabilitation and redevelopment of areas with
the Beltline TAD redevelopment area.

transportation

The  Atlantic  Station  Tax  Allocation  District  was
established in 1999 to facilitate the redevelopment
of  a  138-acre  brownfield  site,  which  had  been
contaminated  due  to  almost  a  century  of  heavy
industrial  use.  The  redevelopment  will  make
maximum use of  alternative transportation modes
to  minimize  congestion,  improve  air  quality,  and
connect major activity centers while also creating a
24-hour  environment  where  one  can  live,  work,
and  play.  The  project  will  ultimately  include  1.6
million square feet of retail, 6 million square feet of
office  and  entertainment  space,  over  4,000
residential units, and 1,150 hotel rooms.

Atlantic Station will lay the  framework for a  more
pedestrian  and  transit-oriented  city.  This  project
will  transform east/west links  into  more  efficient,
aesthetically pleasing transportation corridors and
create  a  financing  vehicle  for  a  mass  transit  link
between the Arts Center MARTA Station and points
beyond.  The  TAD  will  also

The Campbellton Road Tax Allocation District was
created  in  late  2006  and  its  vision  is  to  create  a
major  financial  incentive  that  would  support
creation  of  an  effective public-private partnership
to
facilitate  the  resurgence  of  the  area  by
encouraging  new  substantial,  private  commercial
investment.      The  TAD  will  help  establish  the
framework  for  new  redevelopment  opportunities
and  investment  covering  a  major  arterial  linking
downtown to  the  neighborhoods in the southwest
of the City and provide  an  important  economic

496incentive to enhance the market competitiveness of
a large area in southwestern Atlanta.

The  TAD  was  established with the  goal of  spurring
private,  commercial  redevelopment  activity  along
the  corridor  in  much  the  same  way  existing  TADs
have  attracted  projects  and  promoted  significant
growth and redevelopment in other parts of the City.
The  proposed  TAD  incentives  will  help  this  key
southwest  corridor  compete  aggressively  for  new
development  opportunities  that  might  otherwise
locate outside of the City.  The TAD area consists  of
approximately  1,433  acres  with  585  individual
parcels  along  Campbellton  Road  and  within  five
identified development sub-areas.   The district falls
within Neighborhood Planning Units P, R, S and X.

The Eastside Tax Allocation District was established
in 2003 to join the Westside TAD in allowing the City
to  rebuild  its  Downtown streetscapes and  improve
its  road and utility infrastructure, making  Atlanta a
more  enjoyable  place  to  live,  work  and  play.  The
Eastside TAD  is essential in ensuring that the City of
Atlanta  maintains  its  historical  position  as  the
commercial  center  of
the  metro  region.  The
Eastside TAD, in conjunction with the Westside TAD,
will  create  incentives  for  new  Downtown  housing
and attract the critical mass of permanent residents
needed  to  make  Downtown  a  vibrant  24-hour
activity  center.  Through  carefully  planned  new
development  and  key  quality-of-life  infrastructure
investments  (such  as  new  pedestrian  oriented
streetscapes and public  parking decks), the Eastside
TAD  will  help  to  create  an  attractive,  walkable
Downtown.

historic neighborhood �  Sweet Auburn �  as  well as
one  of  its  most  frequently  traveled  streets,  the
Memorial   Drive/Martin   Luther    King    Jr.    Drive
corridor.  The  Memorial  Drive/MLK  communities
have  an  ambitious,  thoughtfully  conceived  master
plan  in  need  of  implementation funds.  Funding  for
substantial  infrastructure  improvements  is  also
essential  to  the  redevelopment  of  the  Atlanta
Housing  Authority�s  Grady  Homes  and  Capitol
Homes into viable mixed-income communities.

The  Hollowell/M.L.  King  Tax  Allocation  District
was created in late 2006 and its goal is to encourage
private investment in the City�s west and northwest
sectors  by  offering  financing  incentives  that  will
help ameliorate the current conditions contributing
to  disinvestment  and  marginal  use  of  property
within
the  district.  The  TAD  will  provide
inducement  for  certain  major  new  developments
that  will  spur  more  desirable  and  sustainable,
market-based
residential
development in this area.  With careful planning and
guidance,  both  Hollowell  Parkway  and  Martin
Luther  King  Jr.  Drive  �  and  their  surrounding
communities  �  can  be  transformed into  desirable,
viable
friendly
commercial  and  pedestrian-
communities.

collection  of
neighborhoods that have been identified by the City
as  being  in  need  of  such  support.  The  TAD  area
consists  of  approximately  886  acres  within  three
identified  development sub-areas  and  falls  within
Neighborhood Planning Units  G,  H,  I,  J  and  K.  The
primary  purpose  of  the  TAD  is  to  stimulate
commercial  redevelopment  and  create  a  vibrant
retail corridor.

The Metropolitan Parkway Tax Allocation District
was created in late 2006 and its basic purpose is to
generate  public-private  partnerships  that  will
facilitate  the  redevelopment  of  one  of  the  City's
prime development sites within its southern sector.
This  TAD  will  help  balance the disinvestment and
general  lack  of  new  development during  the  past
three  decades  within  the  Metropolitan  Parkway
area  with  the  new  development  and  private
investment occurring in many of Atlanta�s other in-
town  communities.  The  TAD  will  encourage  new
commercial  construction  within  the  Metropolitan
Parkway  Corridor  and  help  accomplish  the
following goals:

�
Promote   the   development   of   infrastructure
and  amenities  such  as  parks  and  plazas  to
encourage  and  support  all  elements  critical  to
building  a  sustainable  community  comprised  of
neighborhoods

including  portions  of

and
the
Summerhill   and   Mechanicsville   neighborhoods
and  provide  an  important  economic  incentive  to
enhance the market competitiveness of the greater
Stadium Neighborhoods area.

The  TAD  incentives  will  allow  this  key  area  just
south  of  the  Central  Business  District  to  compete
aggressively  for  new  development  opportunities
that might otherwise locate outside of the City.  The
TAD area consists of approximately 391 acres with
671 individual parcels located in the areas around
Georgia State Stadium.

The  Westside  Tax  Allocation  District  was
expanded in  1998  in  order  to  support  efforts  that
are  currently  underway  to  remove  blighted
conditions  and  expand  redevelopment  efforts  to
adjacent residential areas of Vine City and English
Avenue.  The  TAD  also  seeks  to  capitalize  on  the
opportunity to  revitalize the  land surrounding the
new  Centennial  Olympic  Park  and  foster  the
development  of  connections  between  the  Central
Business  District,  Clark  Atlanta  University  Center,
the  Georgia  Tech  Campus,  and  adjoining
improved
neighborhoods

The  TAD  will  facilitate  the  development  of  infill
projects  to  eliminate  the  development  gaps  which
exists  because  of  inadequate  and  aging  sewers,
property  acquisition  and  assemblage  costs,  and
perceived environmental contamination.  Through
the  development  of  linkages,  infrastructure,  and
infill  development,  this  TAD  encourages  and
supports  new  and  existing  businesses,  new  and
renovated  housing,  and  the  support  services  that

The TAD contains approximately 1,023 acres in the
southwest quadrant of Atlanta and includes portions
of Neighborhood Planning Units X, Y and Z.

The
Tax
Perry-Bolton/Northwest  Atlanta
Allocation District was established  in 2002 to make
possible  the  redevelopment  of  over  500  acres  of
under-developed real estate in Northwest Atlanta. In
particular,  redevelopment  of  the  Perry  Homes
public housing development will  transform an  area
once
filled  with  derelict  properties  and  old
apartments into a vibrant, mixed-use, mixed- income
community that will improve the economic standing
of  the  City.      Upon  completion,  West  Highlands  at
Heman E. Perry Boulevard will include over 650 new
single  family  homes,  700  apartments,  a  multi-use
trail  built  and  maintained by  the  PATH  foundation
and new parks and greenspace.

other pedestrian- friendly enhancements will attract

for  infrastructure  improvements  and  affordable

in  Carver  Hills,  Almond  Park,  and

The  Stadium  Neighborhoods  Tax  Allocation
District  was  created  in  late  2006  and  its  basic
purpose is to create a major financial incentive that
would support the  creation of  an  effective public-
private partnership to facilitate the resurgence and
redevelopment  of  the  area  closest  to  I-75  and
Georgia  State  Stadium  by  encouraging substantial
new  development.   The  TAD  would  establish  the
framework for  new  redevelopment opportunities

The City of Atlanta�s outstanding debt portfolio consists of five (5) categories of pledged revenues:
General Fund and Other, Aviation Fund, Water & Wastewater Fund, General Obligation Fund, and Tax
Allocation District Fund.

GENERAL FUND & OTHER:

The City has issued various bonds that are supported by the General Fund and Other. The General
Fund  supports  various capital  improvement  projects,  leasing of  equipment  (i.e.  police cars,  dump
trucks, garbage trucks and fire trucks, public safety and traffic court buildings). The total outstanding
debt for the General Fund and Other debt is $537.2 million as of July 1, 2025.

AVIATION FUND:

The City of Atlanta Department of Aviation is one of four cities in the nation that owns and operates
a  world-class  international  airport.  The  Hartsfield-Jackson  Atlanta  International  Airport  is  a  self-
sustaining  enterprise  fund  which  derives  its  operating  revenue  from  landing  fees,  concession
revenues, parking fees, building and land rentals, and passenger facility charges (�PFC�) approved by
the  Federal  Aviation  Authority  (�FAA�).  Capital  Improvements  are  financed  by  excess  operating
revenues, revenue bonds, and grant funding via capital improvement applications submitted to the
FAA. To maintain its position, the City issues bonds for ongoing capital improvement projects which
are pledged against its revenues and have equal lien parity.  Revenues pledged against the bonds
issued are either from General Airport Revenue Bonds (�GARB�), Passenger Facility Charges (�PFC�),
or  Customer  Facility  Charges(�CFC�).  The  total  outstanding  long-term  debt  for  the  Department  of
Aviation is $3.5 billion with a Commercial Paper Program in the amount of $1.4 billion and Revolving
Credit in the amount of $100 million as of July 1, 2025.

WATER & WASTEWATER FUND:

The Department of Watershed Management (the �Department� or �DWM�) was created in 2002. The
Department of Watershed Management is responsible for operating and maintaining the City�s Water
and Wastewater system in compliance with federal and state regulations.  The Department has issued
long-term  bonds,  state  revolving  loans  administered  by  the  Georgia  Environmental  Facilities
Authority (�GEFA�), commercial paper, and other financing vehicles to provide funding for its capital
improvement projects. The bonds and loans issued are pledged against the revenues generated by
the water and wastewater system. The total outstanding long-term debt for the Department is $2.6
billion with a Commercial Paper Program in the amount of $300 million as of July 1, 2025.

599

GENERAL OBLIGATION FUND:

The City is authorized by the State of Georgia to issue annual General Obligation Bonds in the amount
of $8 million without a voter referendum for various public purpose capital improvements. Proceeds
from  these  bonds  are  shared  equally  between  the  City  and  the  Atlanta  Public  Schools.  The  debt
obligation on these bonds is secured by a pledge of the City�s full faith and credit and general property
taxing power. Furthermore, the City is permitted by O.C.G.A. �36-82-1 to issue Public Improvement
Bonds by a voter referendum. The Referendum Bonds, when issued, cannot bear an interest rate that
exceeds 8.5% per annum. The City is required by law to levy an ad valorem tax on all taxable property
within the City in an amount sufficient to make the principal and interest payments that become due.
The total outstanding debt for the General Obligation Bonds is $574.9 million as of July 1, 2025.

TAX ALLOCATION DISTRICT FUND:

The City has issued Tax Allocation District (�TAD�) bonds in accordance with Federal Tax Law which
allows state and local governments to issue tax-exempt securities on behalf of nonprofit corporations
exempt from taxes under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Service Code.

Specifically,  the  Redevelopment  Powers  Law,  O.C.G.A.  �36-44-1,  et  seq.  of  the  State  of  Georgia
Constitution authorizes municipalities to create Tax Allocation Districts. The City has created ten (10)
tax districts, however, only five (5) (Beltline, Eastside, Perry Bolton, Princeton Lakes, and Westside)
are active.  The tax revenues from each active TAD district are pledged against the bonds that the
district issues.  For Fiscal Year 2026, the City will have eight (8) bonds outstanding with a total value
of $126.3 million.

FINANCIAL POLICIES

The  City  of  Atlanta  is  a  municipal  corporation
governed by the Mayor and the City Council.  The
accounting principles of the City of Atlanta, Georgia
(the  "City"),  conform  to  Generally  Accepted
Accounting  Principles  ("GAAP")  applicable  to
governmental  entities.
The  Government
Accounting  Standards  Board  ("GASB")  is  the
accepted  standards  setting  body  for  establishing
governmental  accounting  and  financial  reporting
principles.  The  annual  budget  complies  with
relevant  financial  policies,  including  the  more
significant financial policies of the City as described
below.

Accounting,  Auditing  and  Financial  Reporting
Policies

An  annual  audit  shall  be  performed  by  an
independent  public  accounting  firm  with  the
subsequent  issue  of  an  Annual  Comprehensive
Financial  Report  (ACFR).  The  report  shall  include
audited  general-purpose  financial  statements  and
audited  individual  fund  statements  with  both
introductory and statistical sections, by the end of
the  sixth  month  after  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year.
The  Report  shall  be  prepared  in  conformity  with
GAAP for governments.

is  determined  by

The  accounting  and  financial  reporting  treatment
fund
applied
its
to  a
measurements
focus.  The  government-wide,
proprietary  funds  and  fiduciary  fund  financial
statements  are  reported  using  the  economic
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis
of  accounting.  Revenues  are  recorded  when
earned and expenses are recorded when a liability
is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash
flows.  Property taxes are recognized as revenues
in the year for which they are levied.  Grants and
similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as
the
all  eligibility  requirements
provider have been met.

imposed  by

Governmental  fund  financial  statements  are
reported  using  the  current  financial  resources
measurement  focus  and  the  modified  accrual
basis of accounting.  Revenues are recognized as

soon as they are both measurable and available.

Revenues are considered to be available when they
are  collectible  within  the  current  period  or  soon
enough  thereafter  to  pay  liabilities  of  the  current
period.  For  this  purpose,  the  city  considers
revenues to be available if they are collected within
60  days  of  the  end  of  the  current  fiscal  period.
Expenditures  generally  are  recorded  when  a
liability  is  incurred,  as  under  accrual  accounting.
However,  principal  and  interest  on  general  long-
term  debt,  including  lease  and  subscription-based
information  technology  liabilities,  compensated
absences,  claims  and  judgments,  and  worker�s
compensation are recorded only when payment is
due.  General  capital  asset  acquisitions,  including
entering into contracts giving the City the right-to-
use
information
technology assets, are reported as expenditures in
governmental funds.   Issuance of general long-term
debt
and
and
subscription-based
information  technology  are
reported as other financing sources.

lease  and  subscription-based

financing

through

leases

Property  taxes,  franchise  taxes,  licenses  and
interest associated with the current fiscal period
are all considered to be susceptible to accrual and
have been recognized as revenues of the current
items  are
fiscal  period.  All  other  revenue
considered  to  be  measurable  and  available  only
when cash is received by the city.

Revenue  Recognition  �  Accrual  Basis  of
Accounting

the

The  accrual  basis  of  accounting  is  used  by  all
proprietary fund and fiduciary fund types. Under
the  accrual  basis,  revenue  recognition  occurs
when
transactions  are  earned  and
measurable irrespective of when cash is received.
Measurable means the amount can be determined
accurately.  (Note:  a  transaction  cannot  be
reported unless the amount of the transaction can
be determined.  To record the transaction, either
the actual amount of a transaction or an estimate
must be known to record the transaction). For a
government  to  earn  revenue,  it  must  have
provided the goods or services.

623Revenue Recognition � Modified Accrual Basis of
Accounting

The modified accrual basis of accounting is used by
all  governmental  fund  types.  Under  the  modified
accrual  basis  of  accounting,
revenues  are
recognized when susceptible to accrual (i.e., when
they  become  both  measurable  and  available).
"Measurable" means the amount of the transaction
"available"  means
can  be  determined  and
collectible  within  the  current  period  or  soon
enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the
current  period.  The  city  considers  revenues  as
available if they are collected within 60 days after
year-end.  All revenues are considered susceptible
to  accrual  except  revenues  from  licenses  and
permits,  fines,  forfeitures,  and  penalties  because
they  are  generally  not  measurable  until  cash  is
received.

information

long-term  debt,  including

Expenditures are generally recognized under the
modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting  when  the
related fund liability is incurred. Exceptions to this
general  rule  include:  principal  and  interest  on
lease  and
general
subscription-based
technology
liabilities,  compensated  absences,  claims  and
judgments, and worker�s compensation which are
recorded  only  when  payment  is  due.  General
capital asset acquisitions, including entering into
contracts giving the City the right-to-use lease and
technology
subscription-based
assets,  are
in
governmental  funds.  Issuance  of  general  long-
term  debt  and  financing  through  leases  and
subscription-based  information  technology  are
reported as other financing sources.

Financial Management Policies

Cash & Investments

The city considers all highly liquid debt securities
with an original maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.  The Georgia Fund 1 (Georgia
Fund)  is  a  stable  net  asset  value  investment  pool
managed  by  the  State  of  Georgia  (Office  of  State
Treasurer) and is not registered with the SEC.  The
Georgia  Fund  1  operates  in  a  manner  consistent
with SEC Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act
of  1940  and  is  considered  a  SEC  Rule  2a-7-  like
pool.  The  fair  value  of  the  participant  shares  is
computed  weekly  with  pool  earnings  distributed
monthly  based  on  equivalent  shares  owned  by

participants based on $1.00 per share.

local

investment

The O.C.G.A. 36-83-4 authorizes the city to invest in
(a) Obligations of this state or of other states;
(b) Obligations  issued  by  the  United  States
government;  (c)  Obligations  fully  insured  or
guaranteed by the United States government or a
United States government agency; (d) Obligations
of  any  corporation  of
the  United  States
government;  (e)  Prime  bankers�  acceptances;  (f)

The
government
established  by  Code  Section  36-83-8;
(g)
Repurchase agreements; and
(h) Obligations  of  other  political  subdivisions  of
this  state.  Also,  �pursuant  to  Code  Section 50-
17-53  and  the  other  powers  of  the  State
Depository  Board,  the  State  Depository  Board
shall establish policies and procedures related to
the approval of third-party service providers and
the ongoing monitoring of participation in deposit
placement programs in accordance with this Code
section.� The City�s investment policy follows that
of  State  Code  and  further  puts  limitations  on
Maximum  Maturities,  Ratings  and  Portfolio
Percentage Limitations.  By statute, which differs
from  the  OCGA  36-83-4,  up  to  55%  of  the  cost
basis  of  the  investment  portfolio  for  the  General
Employees� Pension Plan, the Firefighters� Pension
Plan  and  the  Police  Officers�  Pension  Plan  (The
Plans)  may  consist  of  U.S.  corporate  equity
securities.  Additionally,
in  accordance  with
authorized investment laws, the Plans can invest
in  various  mortgage-backed  securities,  such  as
collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") and
government backed mortgage securities. In 2014,
the  General  Employees�  Pension  Board,  the
Firefighters�  Pension  Board  and  the  Police
Officers�  Pension  Board  (The  Pension  Boards)
authorized  The  Plans  to  invest  in  alternative
investments,  not  to  exceed  5%  of  the  total
investments.

Investments, except in the pension funds, consist
primarily  of  U.S.  Government  securities  and  are
stated  at  fair  value.  Pension  fund  investments,
which  also  include  bonds  and  U.S.  Government
and  other  domestic  and  foreign  securities,  are
stated at fair value or net asset value.    Repurchase
Agreements are reported at amortized cost.

The  city  maintains  a  cash  management  pool
whereby operating cash is held.  This pool is not
considered  a  separate  accounting  entity  for

bridges,  sidewalks,  and  similar  items)  used  in
governmental  and  business-type  activities  of  the
City, are recorded in the statement of net position
at  historical  cost  (or  estimated  historical  cost).
Capital assets are defined by the city as assets with
an  initial,  individual  cost  of  $5,000  and  an
estimated  useful  life  of  more  than  one  year.
Donated  capital  assets  are  recorded  at  their
estimated  fair  value  at  the  date  of  donation.
Expenses  for  replacements,  maintenance,  repairs,
and betterments  which do  not  materially prolong
the  life  of  the  related  asset  are  charged  to
expenditures/expenses  when
All
reported
land  and
construction in progress, are depreciated.

capital  assets,  except

incurred.

Compensated Absences

City employees are awarded sick and vacation time
as determined by personnel policies.  A maximum
accrual  of  25  to  45  days  of  vacation  leave  is
authorized, depending upon length of service. The
liability for compensated absences reported in the
government-wide and proprietary fund statements
consists  of  unpaid,  accumulated  vacation  leave
balance.  The liability has been calculated using the
vesting  method,  in  which  vacation  amounts  for
employees  who  currently  are  eligible  to  receive
termination  payments  and  other  employees  who
are  expected  to  become  eligible  in  the  future  to

receive  such  payments  upon  termination  are
included. The liability for compensated absences is
only reported in governmental funds if they have
matured.

Employees  can  accrue  unlimited  amounts  of  sick
leave. Sick leave can be taken only due to personal
illness  or,  in  certain  cases,  the  illness  of  family
members. Sick leave is not intended to be paid out
except under special circumstances where the City
Council  has  given  approval,  and  the  necessary
funds  are  available.  Consequently,  the  City  does
not record an accrued liability for accumulated sick
pay.    The  City  is  in  the  process  of  evaluating  the
impact  of  GASB  Statement  No.  101,  Compensated
Absences,  on  its  financial  statements  and  will
implement the changes in the June 30, 2025 ACFR.

Fund Balance

The City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances Section 6-
315  provides  authority  pertaining  to
fund
balances.  Fund  balances  are  classified  as:  (1)
Nonspendable, (2) Restricted, (3) Committed, (4)
Assigned, and (5) Unassigned.  Nonspendable fund
balance  refers  to  amounts  that  are  not  in
spendable form or are legally required to remain
intact.  Restricted  fund  balance  refers  to  amounts
that  are  subject  to  externally  enforceable  legal
restrictions  by either debt covenants,  or laws or
regulations  of  other  governments.  Committed
fund balance refers  to  amounts  that  can  only  be
used for specific purposes pursuant to constraints
imposed by ordinance of the City Council prior to
the end of the fiscal year.  The same formal action
is required to remove the limitation. Assigned fund
balance refers to amounts that are intended to be
used  for  specific  purposes.  The  Chief  Financial
Officer of the City may recommend assignment of
fund  balances  subject  to  approval  of  the  City
Council.  Unassigned  fund  balances  refer  to  the
residual  net  resources  and  are  the  excess  of
nonspendable,
and
assigned.  Fund  expenditures  can  be  paid  from
restricted  fund  balance  to  the  extent  of  the
restricted  fund  revenue,  followed  by  committed,
assigned, and then unassigned fund balance. The
general  fund  is  the  only  fund  that  reports  a
positive unassigned fund balance amount.

committed,

restricted,

Spending Prioritization Policy

When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for
which
unrestricted
(committed,  assigned,  or  unassigned)  amounts

restricted

both

and

625are  available,  restricted  amounts  shall  be
considered to have been reduced first.  When an
expenditure  is  incurred  for  purposes  for  which
amounts in any of the  unrestricted  fund  balance
classifications could be used, committed amounts
are  reduced  first,  followed  by  assigned  amounts
and then unassigned amounts.

Authority to Commit or Assign Funds Policy

Commitments or assignments of funds will only be
used for specific purposes. Committed balances or
assigned  balances  will  only  be  established
pursuant to formal action by the City Council, upon
recommendation from the Chief Financial Officer.
Such commitments or assignments cannot exceed
the available fund balance in any particular fund.

Minimum  Unrestricted  Balance  in  the  General
Fund Policy

The  City  maintains  a  minimum  unrestricted  fund
balance in the General Fund ranging from  no less
than  15%  to  20%  of  the  subsequent  year�s
budgeted expenditures and outgoing transfers.  At
any  time,  the  unrestricted  fund  balance  is  within
the range of 15% to 20% of the subsequent year�s
budgeted  expenditures  and  outgoing  transfers.
Upon  recommendation  by  the  Chief  Financial
Officer, the City Council  may authorize additional
transfers  to  a  fund  at  its  discretion,  up  to  a
maximum of 5% per year of the subsequent year�s
budgeted revenues in preparation for adoption of
the  upcoming  year�s  budget.  If  the  unrestricted
fund balance falls below the minimum 15% of the
subsequent  year�s  budgeted  expenditures  and
outgoing
of
shortages/deficiencies will be made within specified
time periods and upon the recommendation  of  the
Chief  Financial  Officer.  Should  the  unrestricted
fund  balance  of  the  General  Fund  exceed  the
maximum of 20%, such surplus fund  balance  may
be  considered  for  transfer  to deficit  balances  in
other  funds  and  for  one-time expenditures that
are  nonrecurring.  At  least  50%  of  surplus  fund
balance  must  be  used  to  reduce  any  deficit  fund
balance  prior  to  allocation  for  any  one-  time
expenditure.

Net Position

Net  position  is  classified  and  displayed  in  three
components, as applicable:
Net investment in capital assets � Consists of capital
assets  including  restricted  capital  assets,  net  of

accumulated  depreciation  and  reduced  by  the
outstanding balances of any bonds, notes, or other
borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition,
construction,  or  improvement  of  those  assets.  If
there are significant unspent related debt proceeds
at year-end, the portion of the debt attributable to
the unspent proceeds is excluded.
from  the  calculation  of  net  investment  in  capital
assets.

Restricted  �  Consists  of  assets  with  constraints
placed  on  the  use  either  by  (1)  external  groups,
such as creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws
or  regulations  of  other  governments;  or  (2)  law
through  constitutional  provisions  or  enabling
legislation.  When  an  expense  is  incurred  for
purposes for which there are both restricted and
unrestricted assets available, it is the City�s policy
to apply those expenses to restricted assets, to the
extent such are available, and then to unrestricted
assets.

Unrestricted � All other assets that constitute the
components of net position that do not meet the
definition of �restricted� or �investment in capital
assets.�

Deferred Outflows of Resources

Deferred  outflows  of  resources  represent  a
consumption of net assets that applies to a future
period and will not be recognized as an outflow of
resource  (expense)  until  then.  The  deferred
losses on refunding results from the difference in
the  carrying  value  of  refunded  debt  and
reacquisition  price.  The  amount  is  deferred  and
amortized  over  the  shorter  of  the  life  of  the
refunded or refunding debt.

Deferred Inflows of Resources

Deferred
inflows  of  resources  represent  an
acquisition  of  net  assets  that  applies  to  a  future
period and so will not be recognized as an inflow
of resource (revenue) until that time. Changes in
the fair value of effective hedging derivatives are
reported  as  deferred  inflows  or  outflows  of
resources. The deferred gain on refunding results
from  the  difference  in  the  carrying  value  of
refunded  debt  and  reacquisition  price.  The
amount  is  deferred  and  amortized  over  the
shorter  of  the  life  of  the  refunded  or  refunding
debt.  The  unavailable  revenue  reported  in  the
Balance  Sheet,  which  arises  under  a  modified
accrual  basis  of  accounting,  represents  amounts

626

that  are  deferred  and  recognized  as  an  inflow of
resources in the periods that the amounts become
available.  The  City  also  recognizes  a  deferred
inflow of resources at the initial measurement of
lease receivables.

Grants from Other Governments

the  general  fund,  each  special  revenue  fund,  and
each  debt  service  fund  in  use  by  the
local
government.  A  budget  ordinance  or  resolution  is

beneficial
funding
primarily in the form of grants, is recorded in the
governmental  and  proprietary
funds.  Grant
contributions in the proprietary funds are for the
purpose of construction activities, principal debt
land  or  easement
service  reimbursements,
acquisitions,  or  aid  related  to  the  COVID-19
pandemic. They are recorded in the statement of
revenue, expenses, and changes in net position as
capital contributions and non-capital grants.  For
all funds, a grant receivable is recorded when all
applicable eligibility requirements have been met.

General Services Costs

The City allocates a portion of general services costs
(such  as  purchasing,  accounting,  budgeting,
personnel  administration,  and  certain  other  costs
based  on  allocation  methods  determined  by  an
independent  study)  to  the  Aviation,  Watershed
Management,  Sanitation  Services,    and  Internal
Service Funds to reflect the actual cost of providing
these services more fully.

Use of Estimates

financial  statements

in
The  preparation  of
conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions
that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,
liabilities,  revenues,  expenditures/expenses,  and
disclosures.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those
estimates.

Balanced Budget

The  City  of  Atlanta�s  budget  adoption

states that each unit of local government shall adopt
